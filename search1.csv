Despite their high predictive accuracy, Machine Learning models may not provide sufficient explainability, robustness and/or fairness; therefore, they may not be trustworthy for the involved stakeholders, such as business users, auditors, regulators and end-customers. To measure the trustworthiness of AI applications, we propose the first Key AI Risk Indicators (KAIRI) framework for AI systems, considering financial services as a reference industry. To this aim, we map the recently proposed regulatory requirements proposed for Artificial Intelligence Act into a set of four measurable principles (Sustainability, Accuracy, Fairness, Explainability) and, for each of them, we propose a set of interrelated statistical metrics that can be employed to measure, manage and mitigate the risks that arise from artificial intelligence. We apply the proposed framework to a collection of case studies, that have been indicated as highly relevant by the European financial institutions we interviewed during our research activities.

With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a “Brussels effect” in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries. Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate- and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general. Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI). Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainability in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).",AI act | Artificial intelligence | ChatGPT | EU law | Innovation | Large generative AI models | Product liability | Sustainability,0,1,,,,undefined,

A feature selection method (permutation importance method), nine resampling methods, and six high-performance forecasting methods were employed in the proposed CDFS. The China Taiwan credit card default dataset and South Germany credit dataset were used to test the interpretability and predictive performance of the proposed CDFS. Experiments showed that the feature selection and data balancing modules of the CDFS effectively improve the prediction performance.

Where predictive models view the future as a reflection of the past, financial crises can violate this assumption. This creates a new field of research on how to adjust predictive models to incorporate forward-looking conditions, which include future expected financial crises. The third factor considers the impact of financial technology (Fintech) on the future of predictive modelling.

A peer to-peer (p2p) lending platform built on blockchain can help bridge the gap between potential lenders and borrowers in need of money in a secure and decentralized environment. The Ethereum blockchain allows for the creation of smart contracts to perform actions in the network by setting logic rules and conditions thereby removing the need for middlemen and can be inclusive of the unbanked sector. The p2p platform introduces swarm learning for credit scoring, which is a novel methodology that utilizes smart contracts to train decentralized machine learning models. Each training round happens on the local device with the user data, which then exchanges the training parameters and weights to the machine learning model maintained in the smart contract. This allows for preserving the privacy of the user data by ensuring the data never leaves the device but only the inference does. Upon analyzing the user’s behavior, a statistical credit score is assessed for validating the chances of the user to default his/her loan repayment. The performance of the proposed model that has been trained using the swarm learning technique is close to the model that had been trained in a centralized environment while overcoming the drawbacks of federated learning by incorporating blockchain and swarm methodology.",Credit scoring | Decentralized machine learning | Ethereum blockchain | Peer-to-peer network | Smart contracts | Swarm learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

We also find that the uncertainty-decreasing effect of risk disclosure extends to a positive relation between risk disclosure and firm value. Our study contributes to the call for more transparency in risk reporting and disclosure.

A trivial autoencoder (TAE) is used to change data representation, and modified generative adversarial networks (GAN) are used to create new instances from random noise. The experiment on three different datasets demonstrates that the same classifier achieves a better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on datasets augmented by the proposed framework compared to datasets oversampled by other techniques. Additionally, the results show that datasets balanced by the new framework influence the classifier to change the prediction error types, significantly reducing false negatives; more expensive misclassification case in the imbalance learning.

We aim to illustrate the beneficial use of machine learning (ML) methods whose prediction power is increased by adopting fuzzy theory to calculate the default risk with a better selection of the features contributing to it. An important feature of the CBFC method is that membership values obtained as a result of the fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm are used for the purpose of better capturing the structure of an existing system. An extensive comparison is performed to show how CBFC performs compared to the traditional ones for the datasets having different characteristics in terms of the variable types. Five different real-life datasets are studied to expose the contribution of fuzzy approach on improving the ML use.

The research employed the Louvain clustering algorithm to effectively group the loan recipients based on their cumulative repayment amounts over time, and two distinct machine learning techniques, namely logistic regression (LR) and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) were harnessed to evaluate their efficacy in classifying recipients' risk levels, namely low-risk or high-risk. The LR model achieved mean accuracy score of 100% which indicates a high level of precision that can effectively predict the risk of SME loan repayment. This is further supported by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 1.0 obtained by the LR model which suggests that the model has achieved optimal separation of the two classes, and therefore it is highly reliable for risk prediction. This technique is believed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of credit risk assessment that could enable financial institutions (FIs) to optimize their decision-making processes and mitigate potential losses caused by the defaulting loans.

Application scoring is used to decide whether to grant a loan or not, while behavioral scoring is used mainly for portfolio management and to take preventive actions in case of default signals. In both cases, social network data has recently been shown to be valuable to increase the predictive power of these models, especially when the borrower's historical data is scarce or not available. This study aims to understand the dynamics of creditworthiness assessment performance and how it is influenced by credit history, repayment behavior, and social network features. To accomplish this, we build up a machine learning classification framework demonstrating its value analyzing 97,000 individuals and companies from the moment they obtained their first loan up to 12 months afterward. Our original and massive dataset allowed us to characterize each borrower according to its credit behavior, and socioeconomic relationships. Our study finds that credit scoring based on borrowers’ history improves performance at a decreasing rate during the first six months and then stabilizes. The most notable effect on the performance of credit scoring based on social network features occurs in loan applications; for personal scoring, this effect prevails for approximately six months, while for business scoring, social network features add value throughout the entire study period. These findings are of great value to improve credit risk management and optimize the combined use of both the traditionally exploited information and new alternative data sources.",Application credit scoring | Behavioral credit scoring | Machine learning | Social network data,2,0,repositoryam,Green,EHU,CHILE/2019-21190345,Edge Hill University

However, with the increase in the data volume, the performance of traditional algorithms tends to encounter bottlenecks. Although deep learning methods have advantages in handling big data, they are not commonly applied in credit scoring. As one of the most frequently used methods in deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) use convolutional kernels as feature extraction tools and has been very successful in tasks related to images or text. This is because image and text data naturally have a structural characteristic called spatial local correlation, which means that the pixels or tokens covered by the same convolutional kernel are highly correlated, and they can be jointly processed to extract meaningful feature representations. However, the tabular data used for credit scoring do not naturally have such a characteristic. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel end-to-end soft reordering one-dimensional CNN (SR-1D-CNN), which can adaptively reorganize the original tabular data and make them more conducive to CNN learning. Several real-world credit scoring datasets of different sizes are used for a comprehensive comparison with traditional machine learning classifiers and other deep learning methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the soft reordering mechanism can effectively improve the classification effect of the CNN for tabular data. With the increase in the data scale, the proposed approach obtains superior results to those of other benchmark models.",Convolutional neural networks | Credit scoring | Deep learning | Machine learning | Soft reordering mechanism,0,0,,,,undefined,

Findings: The authors decompose UR into two components – temporary and permanent UR. The authors find the spike in UR during COVID-19 is mainly attributed to the surge in temporary layoffs. More importantly, the authors find that the credit card charge-off rate is primarily driven by permanent UR while temporary UR has little predictive power. During recessions, permanent UR seems to be a stronger indicator than total UR. This research highlights the importance of using permanent UR for credit risk modeling.

The linear logistic regression has developed into a standard calibration approach in the banking sector. With the advent of machine learning techniques in the discriminatory phase of credit risk models, however, the standard calibration approach is currently under scrutiny again. In particular, the assumptions behind the linear logistic regression provide critics with a target. The previous liter-ature has converted the calibration problem into a regression task without any loss of generality. In this paper, we draw on recent academic results in order to sug-gest two new single-parameter families of differentiable functions as candidates for this regression. The derivation of these two families of differentiable functions is based on the maximum entropy principle, and thus it relies on a minimum number of assumptions. We compare the performance of four calibration approaches on a real-world data set and find that one of the new single-parameter families outperforms the linear logistic regression. Further, we develop an approach to quantify that part of the general estimation error of probabilities of default which stems from the statistical dispersion of the discriminatory power.",calibration | credit score | cumulative accuracy profile | logistic regression | margin oconservatism | probability of default,0,0,,,,undefined,

However, the pic-ture has shifted in the last decade, with a significant increase in the number of sovereign defaults. The drivers of this increase are complex and as yet unexplored, but it is clear that factors other than traditional macroeconomic events are significantly underpinning these economies. Therefore, understanding how the drivers of sovereign credit risk have evolved beyond economic and fiscal issues, as well as the importance of additional drivers in sovereign credit risk assessment, is critical. This paper explains the strength of the effect of spillover effects from private sector risks on sovereign debt risk, as well as the impact of rising sustainability risks on sovereign credit risk and their underlying relationship, using the XGBoost classification algorithm and model interpretability techniques, namely Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). First, we dis-cover that private sector risks contribute significantly to sovereign credit risk and that these factors must be considered alongside macroeconomic variables when modeling sovereign credit risk. Further, we find evidence that sustainability risks are financially material to sovereign creditworthiness. The relationship between sustainability risks and sovereign credit risk is complex, follows a nonmonotonic relationship and is highly dependent on country specificities, necessitating the integration of sustain-ability risk factors while accounting for interactions with the economic state of a country.",private sector risks | sovereign credit risk | spillover effects | sustainability risks | XGBoost,1,0,,,,undefined,

(June 2021) to account for predicted climate risk shocks’ impact on a sovereign portfolio’s credit quality on a forward-looking basis and in probabilistic terms. In particular, the portfolio stress testing capability is enhanced by adjusting the severity of the credit shocks to account for climate risk-related events on an additive basis. The benefit to risk managers is that it allows understanding of the impact of climate risk in marginal terms in relation to the original credit shock. The recently created NGFS (the Network for Greening the Financial System) database makes this exercise possible. Moreover, the described approach translates the marginal impact of climate risk scenarios on the portfolio’s credit risk stress testing into capital adequacy metrics dislocations, which facilitates communicating the marginal impact of climate risk scenarios as capital consumption amounts. The paper presents an overview of the underlying model, and the methodological approach developed to adapt the credit risk stress-testing capabilities to account for climate risk using the NGFS database. Moreover, it applies the methodology to a hypothetical sovereign loan portfolio and discusses the results. Over the period considered, the study finds that the transition aspect of climate risk has a more pronounced marginal impact on a sovereign portfolio’s credit risk than the chronic physical aspect of climate risk. Moreover, the results indicate that as the world takes action to transition away from carbon, the credit risk of sovereign portfolios may be exacerbated, especially if there are delays and a lack of coordination across countries and sectors.",capital adequacy | climate risk | credit rating | LASSO | machine learning | Monte Carlo simulation | sovereign risk | stress testing,0,0,,,,undefined,

It has been used to build credit scorecards, estimate the probability of default or churn, identify the next best product in marketing, and many more applications. The machine learning literature has recently introduced several alternative techniques, such as deep learning neural networks, random forests, and factorisation machines. While neural networks and random forests form part of the practitioner’s model-building toolkit, factorisation machines are seldom used. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of factorisation machines to some binary classification problems in banking. To stimulate the practical application of factorisation machines, we implement the fitting routines, based on logit loss and maximum likelihood, on commercially available software that is widely used by banks and other large financial services companies. Logit loss is usually used by the machine learning fraternity while maximum likelihood is popular in statistics. Depending on the coding of the target variable, we will show that these methods yield identical parameter estimates. Often, banks are confronted with predicting events that occur with low probability. To deal with this phenomenon, we introduce weights in the above-mentioned loss functions. The accuracy of our fitting algorithms is then studied by means of a simulation study and compared with logistic regression. The separation and prediction performance of factorisation machines are then compared to logistic regression and random forests by means of three case studies covering a recommender system, credit card fraud, and a credit scoring application. We conclude that logistic factorisation machines are worthy competitors of logistic regression in most applications, but with clear advantages in recommender systems applications where the number of predictors typically outnumbers the number of observations.",credit scoring | factorisation machines | logistic regression | logit loss | machine learning | maximum likelihood estimation | random forests | recommender system,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Likewise, in the physical world, ML models are critical components in autonomous agents such as robotic surgeons and self-driving cars. Among the many ethical dimensions that arise in the use of ML technology in such applications, analyzing morally permissible actions is both immediate and profound. For example, there is the potential for learned algorithms to become biased against certain groups. More generally, in so much that the decisions of ML models impact society, both virtually (e.g., denying a loan) and physically (e.g., driving into a pedestrian), notions of accountability, blame and responsibility need to be carefully considered. In this article, we advocate for a two-pronged approach ethical decision-making enabled using rich models of autonomous agency: on the one hand, we need to draw on philosophical notions of such as beliefs, causes, effects and intentions, and look to formalise them, as attempted by the knowledge representation community, but on the other, from a computational perspective, such theories need to also address the problems of tractable reasoning and (probabilistic) knowledge acquisition. As a concrete instance of this tradeoff, we report on a few preliminary results that apply (propositional) tractable probabilistic models to problems in fair ML and automated reasoning of moral principles. Such models are compilation targets for certain types of knowledge representation languages, and can effectively reason in service some computational tasks. They can also be learned from data. Concretely, current evidence suggests that they are attractive structures for jointly addressing three fundamental challenges: reasoning about possible worlds + tractable computation + knowledge acquisition. Thus, these seems like a good starting point for modelling reasoning robots as part of the larger ecosystem where accountability and responsibility is understood more broadly.",Ethics in AI | Knowledge representation | Machine learnin | Socio-technical systems,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,UKRI,EP/V026607/1,UK Research and Innovation

There have been several credit-scoring models proposed in the banking system. These models, either single classifiers or hybrid and ensemble models determine the class of customers (good or bad accounts). The banks need the probability of default to calculate the expected loss and the unexpected loss and then determine whether their capital is adequate. Generally speaking, the proposed model can utilize n classifiers and m performance metrics, the larger n, and m, the more diverse and more reliable the model is as an estimate of customer classes. We evaluated the proposed model using five common classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), AdaBoost, and probabilistic neural network (PNN), and eight performance metrics. To extract the feature, an optimization approach using genetic algorithms and nine different scenarios were used. We have then calculated the optimal parameters of each algorithm simultaneously by defining the cost-sensitive objective function based on the probability of correctly classifying it into two classes 0 (good) and 1 (bad). We evaluated the performance of the proposed hybrid model using the Iranian dataset and the UCI German and Australian datasets. The results indicate the proposed method provides very good scoring performance. Using this approach, the bank can filter its bad customers based on the tolerance it considers for the probability value, so it can decide whether it should provide loans to that customer.",Credit scoring | Genetic algorithm | Hybrid performance metric | Machine learning | Optimization,3,0,,,,undefined,

To address missing credit information, many researchers have used borrowers’ social interactions as an alternative data source. Exploiting social networking data has traditionally been achieved by hand-crafted feature engineering, but lately, graph neural networks have emerged as a promising alternative. Here we introduce an information-processing framework to improve credit scoring models by blending several methods of graph representation learning: feature engineering, graph embeddings, and graph neural networks. In this approach, we aggregate the methods’ outputs to be fed to a gradient boosting classifier to produce a final creditworthiness score. We have validated this framework over a unique multi-source dataset that characterizes the relationships, interactions, and credit history for the entire population of a Latin American country, applying it to credit risk models, application, and behavior. It also allows us to study both individuals and companies. Our results show that the methods of graph representation learning should be used as complements; they should not be seen as self-sufficient methods, as it is currently done. We improve the creditworthiness assessment performance in terms of the measures of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS), outperforming traditional methods of exploiting social interaction data. In the area of corporate lending, where the potential gain is much higher, our results confirm that the evaluation of a thin-file company cannot solely consider the company's own characteristics. The business ecosystem in which these companies interact with their owners, suppliers, customers, and other companies provides novel knowledge that enables financial institutions to enhance their creditworthiness assessment. Our results let us know when and on which population to use graph data and the expected effects on performance.

For the estimation of the relevant credit risk parameter loss given default (LGD), we find that the different results can be attributed to the modality type of the respective LGD distribution. Specifically, we use cluster analysis to identify heterogeneities among the LGD distributions of loan portfolios of 16 European countries with 32,851 defaulted loans. The analysis leads to three clusters, whose distributions essentially differ in their modality type. For each modality type, we empirically determine the accuracy of 20 estimation methods, including traditional regression and advanced machine learning.

In the early stage of new credit products, there is no business accumulation, only a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, so it is not possible to establish a data-driven supervised credit risk control model. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a financial risk control model based on semi-supervised learning. A dual-model cooperative training method was used to construct high quality pseudo tags. Unlabeled data was used as the communication medium between the models. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning in the financial risk control scenario.",data mining | financial risk control | machine learning | semi-supervised learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for company credit scoring that integrates text and tabular data. Our method uses natural language processing techniques to extract key features from risk assessments made by credit risk experts which are then combined with financial data to predict the likelihood of default within a one-year horizon. We compare different Machine Learning based models for different text embedding techniques.

Quantitative modeling using machine learning techniques can now be used to get better insights from data, automate the process, reduce data management, and increase overall profitability. We used the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology in developing the machine learning solution for the given task of building a binary classifier that can predict loan applicants who are likely to default and who are not.

Performance results are presented in the form of a 2-by-2 confusion matrix, classification reports, and ROC curve for easy understanding.

Traditional credit scoring algorithms frequently rely on manual and rule-based methods, which can be tedious and inaccurate. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have opened up possibilities for creating more reliable and effective credit rating systems. The data are pre-processed, including scaling using the 0–1 normalization method and resolving missing values by imputation. Information gain (IG), gain ratio (GR), and chi-square are three feature selection methodologies covered in the study. While GR normalizes IG by dividing it by the total entropy of the feature, IG quantifies the reduction in total entropy by adding a new feature. Based on chi-squared statistics, the most vital traits are determined using chi-square. This research employs different ML models to develop a hybrid model for credit score prediction. The ML algorithms support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NNs), decision trees (DTs), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) classifiers are employed here for experiments along with IG, GR, and chi-square feature selection methodologies for credit prediction over Australian and German datasets. The study offers an understanding of the decision-making process for informative characteristics and the functionality of machine learning (ML) in credit prediction tasks.

The interpretability of federated learning is a crucial issue due to the lack of user interaction and the complexity of credit data monitoring. We advocate the importance of a credit data processing-as-a-service model, which completes conventional credit models in local environments, in order to overcome these restrictions. In particular, we describe an explainable federated learning and blockchain-based credit scoring system (EFCS) in this work. First, we propose an explainable federated learning method with controllable machine learning efficiency and controllable credit model decision making, thus having controllable credit model complexity and transparent and traceable credit decision-making mechanism. Then, we suggest an explainable federated learning training mechanism for credit data that prevents leakage of the model gradients trained by individual nodes during the training of the overall model. Neither the credit data provider nor the data user has access to the raw data in the credit model training ecosystem. Therefore, privacy protection, model performance, and algorithm efficiency, the core triangular cornerstones of federated learning, when added with model interpretability, together constitute a more secure and trustworthy federated learning-based methodology, thus providing a more reliable service for credit model training and construction. The EFCS scheme is presented via simulations of different types of federated learning and their resistance to system attack, applying the proposed model to six different credit scoring datasets. Extensive experimental analyses support the efficiency, security, and explainability of the EFCS.",Analytics | Byzantine fault-tolerant | Explainable federated learning | Information leakage | Privacy-preserving,0,0,,,COST,CA19130,European Cooperation in Science and Technology

However, given the high business value and confidentiality of credit data, the integration of datasets from multiple institutions for credit scoring modeling may result in privacy leakage. Consequently, in this paper, a horizontal federated learning paradigm is used to protect the local private data of each participant and collaborate to train a powerful shared global model. However, in the collaborative training process, heterogeneous data distributions can result in insufficient learning of the model. To overcome this issue, we propose the federated knowledge transfer (FedKT) method, which exploits the advantages of fine-tuning and knowledge distillation to effectively extract generic and specific knowledge from the early layers and outputs of the global model, respectively, thus improving the learning performance of the local models. We adopt five credit datasets and four performance measures to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Traditionally, CRA has relied on credit scores and financial statements, but with the advent of machine learning (ML) algorithms, lenders have a new tool at their disposal. By and large, ML algorithms are designed to classify borrowers based on their credit history and transactional data while leveraging the entity relationship involved in credit transactions. This study introduces an innovative knowledge graph-driven credit risk assessment model (RGCN-RF) based on the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm. RGCN is employed to identify topological structures and relationships, which is currently nascent in traditional credit risk assessment methods. RF categorises MSMEs based on the enterprise embedding vector generated from RGCN. Extensive experimentation is conducted to assess model performance utilising the Indian MSMEs database.

One of the most difficult and time-consuming tasks in the industry of financial planning is currently the assessment of the credit risk that is posed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). On the other hand, the requirements of such forecasting are not something that can be provided by employing conventional models of credit risk. This article uses a stacking model, which takes into account both technical aspects and macroeconomic data, in order to make predictions regarding the movement of the stock price index in reference to the price that was in effect not too long ago. A recursive application of the cross-validation procedure is carried out in order to produce the input for the second-level classifier. This is done to mitigate the risk of the model being overly constrained by the data. Logistic regression and its regularized version are used as meta-classifiers in the second layer to the fundamental classifier to class learning.

Algorithmic credit scoring (ACS) is increasingly used to assess borrowers' creditworthiness, using technology to glean non-traditional data from smartphones and analyze them through machine-learning algorithms. These processes promise efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness compared with traditional credit scoring. However, this technology raises public concerns about opacity, unfair discrimination, and threats to individual privacy and autonomy. Many countries in Southeast Asia are introducing ACS in consumer finance markets, although - even with the significant concerns raised - there is an ongoing and concerning lag in oversight and regulation of the process. Regulation is vital to delivering big data and AI promises in the financial services market, while ensuring fairness and public interest. This article utilizes Vietnam, where the lending industry deploys ACS but in a situation of legal limbo, as a case-study to analyze the consequences of this technology. Vietnam is one of the foremost Southeast Asian countries in which ACS usage is spreading rapidly, and this provides an excellent opportunity to review the regulation, or lack thereof, and determine the implications that this may have for other countries that are currently introducing ACS in consumer finance markets.

To survive in such competitive markets, new companies need a robust credit-scoring model. However, building a reliable model requires large stable data. The challenge is that datasets are often small, covering only a few months (short-period datasets). Therefore, this study proposes a modified binning method, namely changing a variable’s values into two groups with the smallest distribution differences possible. Modified binning can maintain data trends to avoid future shifting. The simulation was conducted using a real dataset from Indonesian Fintech, comprising 44,917 borrower-level observations with 396 variables. To match the actual conditions, the first three months of data were allocated for modeling and the remaining for testing. Implementing modified binning and logistics regression to testing data results in a more stable score band than standard binning. Compared with other classifier methods, the proposed method obtained the best AUC results on the testing data (0.73). In addition, the proposed method is highly applicable as it can provide a straightforward explanation to upper management or regulators.

Therefore, the use of currently published data from social media platforms, which have shown to contain valuable information regarding the financial stability of companies, should be evaluated. In this data e. g. additional information from disappointed employees or customers can be present. In order to analyze in how far this data can improve the information base for corporate credit risk assessment, Twitter data regarding the ten greatest insolvencies of German companies in 2020 and solvent counterparts is analyzed in this paper. The results from t-tests show, that sentiment before the insolvencies is significantly worse than in the comparison group which is in alignment with previously conducted research endeavors. Furthermore, companies can be classified as prospectively solvent or insolvent with up to 70% accuracy by applying the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm to monthly aggregated sentiment scores. No significant differences in the number of Tweets for both groups can be proven, which is in contrast to findings from studies which were conducted before the Corona-Pandemic. The results can be utilized by practitioners and scientists in order to improve decision support systems in the domain of corporate credit risk analysis. From a scientific point of view, the results show, that the information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers in credit relationships, which are principals and agents according to the principal-agent-theory, can be reduced based on user generated content from social media platforms.

Further, the most common architectures do not effectively integrate economic scenarios to enable stress testing, cash flow, or yield estimation. The present research demonstrates that providing lifecycle and environment functions from Age-Period-Cohort analysis can significantly improve out-of-sample and out-of-time performance as well as enabling the model's use in both scoring and stress testing applications. This method is demonstrated for behavior scoring where account delinquency is one of the provided inputs, because behavior scoring has historically presented the most difficulties for combining credit scoring and stress testing. Our method works well in both origination and behavior scoring. The results are also compared to multihorizon survival models, which share the same architectural design with Age-Period-Cohort inputs and coefficients that vary with forecast horizon, but using a logistic regression estimation of the model. The analysis was performed on 30-year prime conforming US mortgage data. Nonlinear problems involving large amounts of alternate data are best at highlighting the advantages of machine learning. Data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is not such a test case, but it serves the purpose of comparing these methods with and without Age-Period-Cohort inputs.

It is known that Decision Trees (DTs) are suitable for ensembles because they encourage diversity, the key point for the success of an ensemble scheme. Ensembles of DTs have obtained good performance in a wide range of areas, including credit scoring. Some works have highlighted that DTs that employ imprecise probability models, called Credal Decision Trees (CDTs), improve the results of ensembles in credit scoring. The performance of CDT is strongly influenced by a hyperparameter. In fact, it was shown that different values of the hyperparameter might yield different models. Hence, the diversity in ensemble schemes can be increased by randomly selecting the value of the hyperparameter in each CDT, instead of fixing one. In this work, it is shown that increasing the diversity of the ensembles that use CDT by varying the value of the hyperparameter in each base classifier improves the results in credit scoring. Thereby, the use of CDT randomly selecting the value of the hyperparameter would suppose notable economic benefits for banks and financial institutions.

Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology employed technical procedures based on bibliographic and exploratory analyses. A traditional investigation was carried out using the Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases. The papers selection and classification took place in three steps considering only studies in English language and published in electronic journals (from 2008 to 2022). The investigation led up to the selection of 46 publications (10 presenting literature reviews and 36 proposing CSMs). Findings: The findings showed that CSMs are usually formulated using Financial Analysis, Machine Learning, Statistical Techniques, Operational Research and Data Mining Algorithms. The main databases used by the researchers were banks and the University of California, Irvine. The analyses identified 48 methods used by CSMs, the main ones being: Logistic Regression (13%), Naive Bayes (10%) and Artificial Neural Networks (7%). The authors conclude that advances in credit score studies will require new hybrid approaches capable of integrating Big Data and Deep Learning algorithms into CSMs. These algorithms should have practical issues considered consider practical issues for improving the level of adaptation and performance demanded for the CSMs. Practical implications: The results of this study might provide considerable practical implications for the application of CSMs. As it was aimed to demonstrate the application of optimisation methods, it is highly considerable that legal and ethical issues should be better adapted to CSMs. It is also suggested improvement of studies focused on micro and small companies for sales in instalment plans and commercial credit through the improvement or new CSMs. Originality/value: The economic reality surrounding credit granting has made risk management a complex decision-making issue increasingly supported by CSMs. Therefore, this paper satisfies an important gap in the literature to present an analysis of recent advances in optimisation methods applied to CSMs. The main contribution of this paper consists of presenting the evolution of the state of the art and future trends in studies aimed at proposing better CSMs.",Credit scoring | Literature review | Optimization methods | Risk management,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,CNPq,2700441,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico

Using alternative data and processing techniques that leverage machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), these models are designed to bypass existing barriers to risk-based pricing, which is the idea that financial institutions offer different interest rates to consumers based on their likelihood of default. Through an algorithmic audit of one lender's (Upstart) credit scoring model, I find that alternative data, particularly whether an applicant has a bachelor's degree, strongly impacted loan outcomes. This raises important equity concerns about overhauling lending criteria via opaque models that restructure the logic of risk assessment. In following the logic of risk assessment generated by Upstart's model, I also audit three fintech-bank partnerships and examine the balance sheets of banks providing capital via Upstart's platform. This is done to demonstrate rising capital allocation to these types of loans at banks engaged in fintech-bank partnerships, in one case rising from 0.14% to 15.6% of the banks’ balance sheet over three years. My analysis shows that alternative credit scoring systems function as a key piece of calculative infrastructure, which allows some institutions to bypass barriers to risk-based pricing, and becomes an infrastructural site for tech startups to partner with financial institutions seeking out new sources of revenue.",algorithmic audit | financial inclusion | financialization | Fintech-bank | infrastructure,0,0,,,,undefined,

Firms are trying to get back to pre-Covid utilization of plant capacity or pivot their business models differently to seize newer opportunities amidst the crisis. We considered the change in operating expenditure (primarily decrease) as our proxy for uncertainty as firms were forced to cut down majorly on their operations and thus incurred lesser variable costs. In an economy showing inflationary trends, the operating expenses will generally increase.

This paper presents an evidence reasoning (ER) rule-based ensemble learning approach for credit risk evaluation considering customer heterogeneity. Firstly, customers are segmented into different groups by <FOR VERIFICATION>k-means clustering algorithms and a two-stage weighting method is proposed to determine the significances of attributes by their discriminating powers between groups and within groups. Then, the attribute-related evidence is obtained by Bayesian statistics to represent the relationships between the attributes and credit risks, and a two-stage weighting evidential reasoning (TER) is developed as a base learner for credit scoring. Lastly, multiple base learners TERs are aggregated for evaluating customers' credit risks. An empirical study on three credit datasets demonstrated that the proposed approach can achieve high performance with good explainability. The predicted results of the model can be well comprehended by providing the contribution of attributes and the activated rules in evidential reasoning processes.",Credit risk evaluation | customer heterogeneity | ensemble learning | evidence reasoning rule,0,0,,,,undefined,

As an example, the credit-worthiness-assessment task is now strongly based on Machine Learning algorithms that make decisions independently from humans. Several studies showed remarkable improvement in reliability, customer care, and return on investment. Nonetheless, many users remain sceptical since they perceive the whole as only partially transparent. The trust in the system decision, the guarantee of fairness in the decision-making process, the explanation of the reasons behind the decision are just some of the open challenges for this task. Moreover, from the financial institution's perspective, another compelling problem is credit-repayment monitoring. Even here, traditional models (e.g., credit scorecards) and machine learning models can help the financial institution in identifying, at an early stage, customers that will fall into default on payments. The monitoring task is critical for the debt-repayment success of identifying bad debtors or simply users who are momentarily in difficulty. The financial institution can thus prevent possible defaults and, if possible, meet the debtor's needs. In this work, the authors propose an architecture for a Creditworthiness-Assessment duty that can meet the transparency needs of the customers while monitoring the credit-repayment risk. This preliminary study carried out an experimental evaluation of the component devoted to the credit-score computation and monitoring credit repayments. The study shows that the authors’ architecture can be an effective tool to improve current Credit-scoring systems.

In order to have a more relevant and accurate classification model, it is necessary for models to be interpreted and understood by financial professionals. The interaction and interpretation of the model becomes more limited as the number of features increases. In order to reduce the number of non significant features, feature selection must be implemented on the original data. The purpose of this study is not only to find a set of logical rules in an easily interpretable form for classification but also to select a set of informative features that can solve the classification problem. To this end, we present a combination of feature selection and rule extraction techniques. The experiment were carried out with the Australian Credit Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of 13 attributes and a decision variable. The experimental results show that the used techniques are efficient in terms of interpretability, comprehensibility and accuracy.",Credit risk assessment | Credit scoring | Decision rules | Feature selection | Rule extraction,0,0,,,MHE&amp;SR,Alkhawarizmi/2020/01,Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research

Recently, there has been a surge in the application of machine learning approaches in the design of robust and effective credit scoring models as part of the human social development agenda under the assumption that the variables will remain stable for a long time. However, in real-life, the behavior of customers changes over time and the variables used to quantify the financial credibility of a person for a loan such as past performances on debt obligations, profiling, main household, income and demographics tend to drift and evolve over time. This paper considers credit scoring as an ephemeral scenario as variables tend to drift over time and proposes the application of data stream learning techniques in credit scoring since they are tailored for incremental learning. This makes the scoring model to be able to detect and adapt to changes in the customer behavior. We propose the Adaptive and Dynamic Heterogeneous Ensemble (ADHE) approach that is capable of learning incrementally and adapting to drifting variables and consists of models derived from different learning algorithms to exploit diversity. The prediction performance of ADHE is evaluated using datasets that are publicly available and we compared the accuracy and computational cost of ADHE with existing state of the art models. Our proposed approach performs significantly well when compared to existing state of the art benchmark models on prediction accuracy according to the non-parametric test.",Credit scoring | Diversity | Heterogeneous ensemble | Machine learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

The major barrier for banks is the defaults on the credits they give to the customer. As banks profit mostly from the loans they give to customer, hence, it is required that they possess a solid and efficient model to minimize the losses they incur via the credit defaults. This article assesses the credit card default prediction’s performance. Earlier the credit card defaults were tallied using standard tools such as FICO scores, but with the development of machine learning, it became much easier to build highly effective risk prediction model. Anyone with a bit of machine learning knowledge would know that credit risk prediction is nothing but a mere binary classification problem. Thus, various machine learning models such as KNN, decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression have been applied. When we look into the credit risk of credit card clients, it indicates that random forest best specifies the aspects to examine with an accuracy of 82% and an area under curve of roughly 77%.",Credit card fraud | Credit cards | Data science default model prediction | Machine learning | Risk prediction,0,0,,,,undefined,

The global problem is to predict the event probability over time. It has applications in healthcare, credit scoring, etc. The most widely used method for assessing the covariate impacts on survival is the Cox proportional hazards approach. However, the assumption of non-overlapping survival functions usually does not hold on real data, and the linear dependence on features limits the quality of the method. There are tree-based machine learning methods to solve these problems. Usually, to evaluate the difference between the samples, it used the log-rank test. Obtained survival decision tree models also have strong interpretability, they can evaluate the importance of predictors, but they demonstrate inferior performance in comparison to Cox proportional hazards models. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new boosting of the survival decision tree model that uses adaptive sampling and weighted log-rank split criteria. The model iteratively corrects an error in the ensemble. Each decision tree is trained on a sample, taking into account the weights of observations and subsequently adjusting the probabilities of getting into the next sample. We introduce an experimental comparison of the proposed adaptive boosting method against Cox proportional hazard and widely used survival trees and their ensembles: random forest and gradient boosting. Experiments on healthcare datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art survival models in terms of the following metrics: the concordance index, the integrated Brier score, and the integrated AUC.",Adaptive boosting | Cox proportional hazard | Gradient boosting survival analysis | Machine learning | Random survival forest | Survival analysis | Time-to-event analysis,0,0,,,,undefined,

The proposed ODL-FCP technique incorporates two phases: Archimedes optimization algorithm based feature selection (AOA-FS) algorithm and optimal deep convo-lution neural network with long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) based data classification. The ODL-FCP technique involves a sailfish optimization (SFO) algorithm for the hyperparameter optimization of the CNN-LSTM method. The performance validation of the ODL-FCP technique takes place using a benchmark financial dataset and the outcomes are inspected in terms of various metrics. The experimental results highlighted that the proposed ODL-FCP technique has outperformed the other techniques.",deep learning | FCP | financial sector | metaheuristics | prediction | sailfish optimization | Small medium-sized enterprises,4,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

However, the financial applications based on machine learning methods mainly focus on stock market predictions. Few studies have explored credit risk predictions. Understanding credit risk trends can help investors avoid market risks. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prediction model that can effectively predict credit default swaps (CDS). Design/methodology/approach: A novel generative adversarial network (GAN) for CDS prediction is proposed. The authors take three features into account that are highly relevant to the future trends of CDS: historical CDS price, news and financial leverage. The main goal of this model is to improve the existing GAN-based regression model by adding finance and news feature extraction approaches. The proposed model adopts an attentional long short-term memory network and convolution network to process historical CDS data and news information, respectively. In addition to enhancing the effectiveness of the GAN model, the authors also design a data sampling strategy to alleviate the overfitting issue. Findings: The authors conduct an experiment with a real dataset and evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The components and selected features of the model are evaluated for their ability to improve the prediction performance. The experimental results show that the proposed model performs better than other machine learning algorithms and traditional regression GAN. Originality/value: There are very few studies on prediction models for CDS. With the proposed novel approach, the authors can improve the performance of CDS predictions.

Machine learning-based approaches have made promising progress in credit risk assessment by treating it as imbalanced binary classification tasks. However, few efforts have been made to deal with the class overlap problem that accompanies imbalances simultaneously. To this end, this study proposes a Tomek link and genetic algorithm (GA)-based under-sampling framework (TEUS) to address the class imbalance and overlap issues in binary credit classification by eliminating majority class instances with considering multi-perspective factors. TEUS first determines boundary majority instances with Tomek link, then take the distance from each majority instance to its nearest boundary as the radius and assigns the density of opposite class samples within the radius as the overlap potential of that majority instance. Second, TEUS weighs each non-borderline majority instance based on its information contribution in estimating class labels. After partitioning non-borderline majority instances into subgroups according to overlap potential and information contribution, TEUS applies GA to select samples from subgroups and merge them with the minority samples into a new training set. Innovatively, the design of the fitness function in GA and the grouping of the non-borderline majority not only trade off the multi-perspective characteristics of instances but also help reduce the computational complexity of the sampling optimization search. Numerical experiments on real-world credit data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TEUS.",class overlap | credit classification | evolutionary under-sampling | genetic algorithm | Imbalance classification,2,0,,,NKRDPC,9162003,National Key Research and Development Program of China

Consequently, AI systems increasingly affect humans, yet many state-of-the-art systems lack transparency and thus, deny the individual’s “right to explanation”. As a remedy, researchers and practitioners have developed explainable AI, which provides reasoning on how AI systems infer individual predictions. However, with recent legal initiatives demanding comprehensive explainability throughout the (development of an) AI system, we argue that the pre-processing stage has been unjustifiably neglected and should receive greater attention in current efforts to establish explainability. In this paper, we focus on introducing explainability to an integral part of the pre-processing stage: feature selection. Specifically, we build upon design science research to develop a design framework for explainable feature selection. We instantiate the design framework in a running software artifact and evaluate it in two focus group sessions. Our artifact helps organizations to persuasively justify feature selection to stakeholders and, thus, comply with upcoming AI legislation.

Rigorous performance measures used in credit scoring literature and practice (such as AUROC and the H-Measure) indicate that our approach deals effectively with population drift and that local models outperform their corresponding global ones in all cases.

Therefore, banks attempt to improve the performance of their credit scoring models while ensuring the interpretability of the results. However, there is a tradeoff between the logistic regression model and machine learning-based techniques regarding interpretability and model performance because machine learning-based models are a black box. To deal with the tradeoff, in this study, we present a two-stage logistic regression method based on the Bayesian approach. In the first stage, we generate the derivative variables by linearly combining the original features with their explanatory powers based on the Bayesian inference. The second stage involves developing a credit scoring model through logistic regression using these derivative variables. Through this process, the explanatory power of a large number of original features can be utilized for default prediction, and the use of logistic regression maintains the model's interpretability. In the empirical analysis, the independent sample t-test reveals that our proposed approach significantly improves the model’s performance compared to that based on the conventional single-stage approach, i.e., the baseline model. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics show a 3.42 percentage points (%p) increase, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic shows a 2.61%p increase. Given that our two-stage modeling approach has the advantages of interpretability and enhanced performance of the credit scoring model, our proposed method is essential for those in charge of banking who must explain credit evaluation results and find ways to improve the performance of credit scoring models.",Bayesian approach | Credit scoring model | Machine learning | Two-stage logistic regression,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

To address this challenge, we first harness the internal ratings-based approach to identify up to 13 risk components that we classify into 3 main categories—statistics, technology, and market conduct. Second, to evaluate the importance of each risk category, we collect a series of regulatory documents related to three potential use cases—regulatory capital, credit scoring, or provisioning—and we compute the weight of each category according to the intensity of their mentions, using natural language processing and a risk terminology based on expert knowledge. Finally, we test our framework using popular ML models in credit risk, and a publicly available database, to quantify some proxies of a subset of risk factors that we deem representative. We measure the statistical risk according to the number of hyperparameters and the stability of the predictions. The technological risk is assessed through the transparency of the algorithm and the latency of the ML training method, while the market conduct risk is quantified by the time it takes to run a post hoc technique (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the output.",Artificial intelligence | Bias | Credit risk | Internal ratings based model | Interpretability | IRB model | Machine learning | Natural language processing | NLP,5,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Unsupervised Learning plays a significant role in dividing customers into similar groups based on several parameters. If customers are clustered in groups optimally, it leads towards the retrieval of better precision from machine learning models applied to customers associated with the clusters. Different machine learning algorithms (Linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression and random forest) were applied on the obtained clusters through K-means, hierarchical and HK Means clustering algorithm, and predictive accuracy is compared with the accuracy obtained via applying mentioned machine learning models on the whole dataset. In this paper, a novel approach of combining K Means and hierarchical clustering (HK Means) is used. In this approach, HK means clustering algorithms are applied on the factorial coordinates, obtained from multiple correspondence analyses for segmenting customers into optimal groups has been proposed. The accuracy of the clustering techniques is evaluated from the decomposition of inertia. The results demonstrate that the combination of K Means and hierarchical clustering proved to be optimal clustering techniques for customer segmentation which can be used further for applying Machine Learning techniques for credit risk analysis.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

Traditionally, credit-risk management relies on credit scoring that predicts loans’ probability of default. In this paper, we use a profit scoring approach that is based on modeling the annualized adjusted internal rate of returns of loans. To validate our profit scoring models with traditional credit scoring models, we use data from a European P2P lending market, Bondora, and also a random sample of loans from the Lending Club P2P lending market. We compare the out-of-sample accuracy and profitability of the credit and profit scoring models within several classes of statistical and machine learning models including the following: logistic and linear regression, lasso, ridge, elastic net, random forest, and neural networks. We found that our approach outperforms standard credit scoring models for Lending Club and Bondora loans. More specifically, as opposed to credit scoring models, returns across all loans are 24.0% (Bondora) and 15.5% (Lending Club) higher, whereas accuracy is 6.7% (Bondora) and 3.1% (Lending Club) higher for the proposed profit scoring models. Moreover, our results are not driven by manual selection as profit scoring models suggest investing in more loans. Finally, even if we consider data sampling bias, we found that the set of superior models consists almost exclusively of profit scoring models. Thus, our results contribute to the literature by suggesting a paradigm shift in modeling credit-risk in the P2P market to prefer profit as opposed to credit-risk scoring models.",Credit scoring | Financial intermediation | Fintech | P2P | Profit scoring,6,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,H2020,1/0497/21,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major tool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency, explainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction accuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the model accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates explainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with regulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are unlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet regulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and enforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the neural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes monotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of training a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a neural additive model, as a free lunch. We demonstrate through empirical results that our new model is as accurate as black-box fully-connected neural networks, providing a highly accurate and regulated machine learning method.",fairness | model explainability | neural networks,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

International trade supply chain financial services have played an important role in solving supply chain enterprise financing. As far as the energy industry is concerned, international trade supply chain financial services can provide sufficient credit support for energy companies. This solves the financing dilemma of small and medium-sized energy companies in import and export trade, and can also improve the capital turnover rate of large energy companies. However, because the international trade supply chain financial service still faces the influence of risks such as corporate credit risk, bank operational risk, and supply chain enterprise information transmission risk, its function of providing financing has not been fully exerted. Early warning and control of risks existing in international trade supply chain financial services can fully play the role of international trade supply chain financial services in promoting the development of the energy industry. Therefore, this article used three artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, including artificial neural network, genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, to analyze the risk of financial services in the international trade supply chain of the energy industry. A risk early-warning model about the financial services of the international trade supply chain of the energy industry was constructed, and an experimental study on the risk early-warning model was carried out. Research showed that the risk early warning model based on AI algorithm enabled banks to improve the accuracy of corporate credit assessment by 7.43% and the accuracy of information collection by 5.61%. It improved the forecast accuracy of external environmental risks by 3.52%, and reduced bank operational risk by 6.58% and legal and regulatory risk by 7.06%.",Artificial intelligence algorithm | Energy industry | International trade supply chain financial service risk | Risk warning model based on AI algorithm | Supply chain financial services,1,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,Wonkwang University

Local feature attribution methods have become a popular technique for post-hoc and model-agnostic explanations. However, attribution methods typically assume a stationary environment in which the predictive model has been trained and remains stable. As a result, it is often unclear how local attributions behave in realistic, constantly evolving settings such as streaming and online applications. In this paper, we discuss the impact of temporal change on local feature attributions. In particular, we show that local attributions can become obsolete each time the predictive model is updated or concept drift alters the data generating distribution. Consequently, local feature attributions in data streams provide high explanatory power only when combined with a mechanism that allows us to detect and respond to local changes over time. To this end, we present CDLEEDS, a flexible and model-agnostic framework for detecting local change and concept drift. CDLEEDS serves as an intuitive extension of attribution-based explanation techniques to identify outdated local attributions and enable more targeted recalculations. In experiments, we also show that the proposed framework can reliably detect both local and global concept drift.

How to effectively prevent hidden debt risk has always been a hot issue in public-private partnership (PPP) financing management research. In recent years, machine learning has become more and more popular in the study of enterprise credit evaluation. However, most scholars only focus on the output of the model, and do not explain in detail the extent to which variables affect the model and the decision-making process of the model. In this paper, we aim to apply a better credit rating method to the key factors and analysis of LGFV’s default risk, and analyze the decision-making process of the model in a visual form. Firstly, this paper analyzes the financial data of LGFVs. Secondly, the XGBoost-logistic combination algorithm is introduced to integrate the typical characteristics of PPP projects and construct the credit evaluation model of LGFVs. Finally, we verify the feasibility of the model by K-fold cross validation and performance evaluation. The results show that: (1) net worth, total assets, operating income, and return on equity are the most critical factors affecting the credit risk of LGFVs, asset-liability ratio and tax revenue are also potentially important factors; (2) the XGBoost-logistic model can identify the key factors affecting the credit risk of LGFVs, and has better classification performance and predictive ability. (3) The influence of each characteristic variable on model decision can be quantified by the SHAP value, and the classification decision visualization of the model improves the interpretability of the model.",combination model | credit rating | gradient promotion algorithm | machine-learning | public-private partnerships,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,216051360020XN225/004,Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation

In order to solve these issues, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based VSG methodology with feature engineering is proposed for credit risk assessment with data scarcity. In this methodology, ELM-based VSG methodology is first used to generate virtual samples and solve data instance scarcity (i.e., small sample) issue. Second, feature engineering is used to solve data attribute scarcity (i.e., low dimensionality) issue. Finally, various classifiers are used to predict the performance for generated virtual samples.

A class imbalance occurs when the number of non-default cases outweighs the number of default cases. A naive classifier can achieve high accuracy by assigning all cases to the majority class; however, misclassifying the minority class is often costly. In XGBoost, a well-known and robust classification method, we propose that the quantile function of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is used as a link function to enhance the detection of rare cases. To complement the GEV link function, the study applies a modified focal loss function in XGBoost to jointly penalize misclassification of the class of interest and focus on hard, tricky to classify cases. We test our proposal on a vast database of mortgage loans with rare default cases, available on the Freddie Mac website. As benchmarks, we also consider other common large credit scoring databases, existing extensions of XGBoost to handle classification imbalance and other state-of-the-art classification techniques for learning class-imbalanced data. According to the results, the proposed model has a superior predictive power to other competing models if the class imbalance is due to default events being outliers or rare in the dataset.

MBS are made of individual mortgages extended to US homeowners. The ability for a homeowner to refinance at any point introduces complexity in prepayment analysis and investing in the MBS sector. Traditional prepayment modeling has been able to capture many of the relationships between prepayments and related factors such as the level of interest rates and the value of the embedded prepayment option, yet the manual nature of variable construction and sheer amount of available data make it difficult to capture the dynamics of extremely complex systems. The long history and large amount of data available in MBS make it a prime candidate to leverage machine learning (ML) algorithms to better explain complex relationships between various macro-and microeconomic factors and MBS prepayments.

However, we provide evidence that the credit rating agency’s reputation can certify differences in ratings’ reliability and further impact bond pricing. On the basis of a sample of 7941 local government bonds issued from 2015 to 2021, results show that risk premium is significantly low for bonds rated by prestigious credit rating agencies, which means that issuers can save borrowing costs. Moreover, local governments regarded as less transparent in fiscal information disclosure enjoy more cost savings for their bonds by hiring more reputable agencies. Regression results are affirmed with the Heckman two-stage model, difference-in-differences regression, and machine learning method to solve the potential endogeneity issue. This paper’s findings contribute to the debate on the credit rating agency’s reputation hypothesis and present three implications. First, investors can rely on the credit rating agency’s reputation to complement credit risk analysis. Second, local government policymakers should implement appropriate policies to reduce debt costs and improve public finance sustainability. Lastly, regulators should considerably focus on the supervision of credit rating agencies, given their substantial impact on bond pricing and the market’s information asymmetry.",,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

The model makes full use of non-missing information and interpolates more missing columns with fewer missing values. In this way, not only the data features needed for missing data interpolation are extracted, but also the structural relationship features between the predicted target and the existing data are extracted, which can achieve the effect of simultaneous interpolation and prediction.

In the literature, there have been a number of studies concerning credit risk management, often involving credit scoring systems making use of machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the specificity of individual banks’ datasets means that choosing the techniques best suited to the needs of a given bank is far from straightforward. This study was motivated by the need by Credins Bank in Tirana for a reliable customer credit scoring tool suitable for use with that bank’s specific dataset. The dataset in question presents two substantial difficulties: first, a high degree of imbalance, and second, a high level of bias together with a low level of confidence in the recorded data. These shortcomings are largely due to the relatively young age of the private banking system in Albania, which did not exist as such until the early 2000s. They are shortcomings not encountered in the more conventional datasets that feature in the literature. The present study therefore has a real contribution to make to the existing corpus of research on credit scoring. The first important question to be addressed is the level of imbalance. In practice, the proportion of good customers may be many times that of bad customers, making the impact of unbalanced data on classification models an important element to be considered. The second question relates to bias or incompleteness in customer information in emerging and developing countries, where economies tend to function with a large amount of informality. Our objective in this study was identifying the most appropriate ML methods to handle Credins Bank’s specific dataset, and the various tests that we performed for this purpose yielded abundant numerical results.

In credit evaluations, the accepted sample is labeled and the rejected sample is unlabeled. This paper used S4VM to model both the accepted and rejected samples for reject inference. Because of the basic semi-supervised learning assumption that the accepted and rejected sample distributions are similar, this paper used a three-way decision method to filter the rejected samples to ensure the accepted and rejected sample distributions were closer. It was found that this method filtered out some rejected samples that were significantly different from the accepted sample distribution, which reduced the interference in the S4VM low-density separator.

One of the most critical challenges in the aforementioned sector is fraud detection upon streams of transactions. Recently, deep learning models have been introduced to deal with the specific problem in terms of detecting and forecasting possible fraudulent events. The aim is to estimate the unknown distribution of normal/fraudulent transactions and then to identify deviations that may indicate a potential fraud. In this paper, we elaborate on a novel multistage deep learning model that targets to efficiently manage the incoming streams of transactions and detect the fraudulent ones. We propose the use of two autoencoders to perform feature selection and learn the latent data space representation based on a nonlinear optimization model. On the delivered significant features, we subsequently apply a deep convolutional neural network to detect frauds, thus combining two different processing blocks.

Statistical and machine learning methods have been working well in predicting the probability of bankruptcy for different time horizons prior to the failure. In recent years, bank efficiency has attracted much interest from academic circles, where low productivity or efficiency in banks has been regarded as a potential reason for failure. It is generally believed that low efficiency implies low-quality management of the organisation, which may lead to bad performance in the competitive financial markets. Previous papers linking efficiency measures calculated by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to bank failure prediction have been limited to cross sectional analyses. A dynamic analysis with the updated samples is therefore recommended for bankruptcy prediction. This paper proposes a nonparametric method, Malmquist DEA with Worst Practice Frontier, to dynamically assess the bankruptcy risk of banks over multiple periods. A total sample of 4426 US banks over a period of 15 years (2002–2016), covering the subprime financial crisis, is used to empirically test the model. A static model is used as the benchmark, and we introduce more extensions for comparisons of predictive performance. Results of the comparisons and robustness tests show that Malmquist DEA is a useful tool not only for estimating productivity growth but also to give early warnings of the potential collapse of banks. The extended DEA models with various reference sets and orientations also show strong predictive power.",Bank efficiency | Bank failure | Bankruptcy prediction | Data Envelopment Analysis | Dynamic model,8,1,repositoryvor,Green,"NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC",71703127,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Today, machine learning algorithms, sometimes trained on alternative data, are increasingly being used to determine access to credit, yet research has shown that machine learning can encode many different versions of ""unfairness,""thus raising the concern that banks and other financial institutions could-potentially unwittingly-engage in illegal discrimination through the use of this technology. In the US, there are laws in place to make sure discrimination does not happen in lending and agencies charged with enforcing them. However, conversations around fair credit models in computer science and in policy are often misaligned: fair machine learning research often lacks legal and practical considerations specific to existing fair lending policy, and regulators have yet to issue new guidance on how, if at all, credit risk models should be utilizing practices and techniques from the research community. This paper aims to better align these sides of the conversation. We describe the current state of credit discrimination regulation in the United States, contextualize results from fair ML research to identify the specific fairness concerns raised by the use of machine learning in lending, and discuss regulatory opportunities to address these concerns.",algorithmic fairness | ecoa | fair lending law | fair machine learning | machine learning,4,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Although such models have been developed to try to reduce human bias and thus bring greater fairness to financial services decisions, studies have found that there is still significant discrimination by both face-To-face and algorithmic lenders. In fact, Apple has recently been investigated for gender discrimination in assigning a credit limit to its users, demonstrating that there may still be inherent biases in the development of such algorithms and models. Furthermore, biases in financial services models may not only lead to unfair discrimination but were also linked to health problems and recovery prospects. This project aims to analyse and identify the different types of biases found in AI models and data used in the financial services industry. We propose a method using data analysis and explainable models to explain how these biases emerge throughout the process of developing AI models as well as applying state-of-The-Art bias dealing techniques to avoid and mitigate them. Finally, we propose how to evaluate these models according to the business objectives and consider possible trade-offs between different definitions of fairness. Thus, the main questions that this project will try to answer are as follows:-What are the current biases in credit risk and fraud detection models and how to identify them?-In what ways understanding how biases emerge from the data can help us in bias mitigation?-To what extent could credit risk and fraud detection models bias be mitigated, and what are the implications of those mitigation techniques? Answering these questions, we hope to create a pipeline for building these models by understanding the key points where bias can emerge and the appropriate methods to avoid it.",bias | fairness | financial services | machine learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

However, despite the essential role of borrowers' personalities on their financial decisions, psychological factors, which can also be mined from their personally written text, receive less attention in current literature. It is challenging to apply extant psychometric approaches for online credit assessment tasks. Specifically, under the chaotic social media environment, social media postings published by the borrowers may not be composed by themselves, and therefore their real psychological statuses are difficult to be uncovered through existing approaches. To solve this problem, guided by the design science methodology and grounded on the Systemic Functional Linguistic Theory, we propose a novel IT artifact, named as PsyCredit, which is a deep learning-based online risk assessment framework driven by a novel psychometric approach. Unlike traditional deep learning approaches, which is a black box, results given by PsyCredit are interpretable by leveraging the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation technique, for the sake of high usability.

This selective discard can lead to an inability to increase the number of potentially qualified applicants, ultimately affecting the revenue of the lending platform. One way to deal with this is to employ reject inference, a technique that infers the state of a rejected sample and incorporates the results into a credit-scoring model. The most popular approach to reject inference is to use a credit-scoring model built only on accepted samples to directly predict the status of rejected samples. However, the distribution of accepted samples in online P2P lending is different from the distribution of rejected samples, and the credit-scoring model on the original accepted sample may no longer apply. In addition, the acceptance sample may also include applicants who cannot repay the loan. If these applicants can be filtered out, the losses to the lending platform can also be reduced. Therefore, we propose a global credit-scoring model framework that combines multiple feature selection methods and classifiers to better evaluate the model after adding rejected samples. In addition, this study uses outlier detection methods to explore the internal relationships of all samples, which can delete outlier applicants in accepted samples or increase outlier applicants in rejected samples. Finally, this study uses four data samples and reject inference to construct four different credit-scoring models. The experimental results show that the credit-scoring model combining Pearson and random forest proposed in this study has significantly better accuracy and AUC than other scholars. Compared with previous studies, using outlier detection to remove outliers in loan acceptance samples and identify potentially creditworthy loan applicants from loan rejection samples is a good strategy. Furthermore, this study not only improves the accuracy of the credit-scoring model but also increases the number of lenders, which in turn increases the profitability of the lending platform.",credit scoring | financial markets | machine learning | P2P lending,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,MOST,MOST 110-2410-H-224-010,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan"

In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method that aims to identify and pseudo-label parts of the historically declined loan applications to mitigate sampling bias in the training data. We also introduce a new measure to assess the performance from the business perspective, loan application approval rates at various loan default rate levels. Our proposed methods were compared to the original supervised learning model and the traditional sampling issue remedy techniques in the industry. The experiment and early production results from deployed model show that self-training method with calibrated probability as data augmentation selection criteria improved the ability of credit scoring to differentiate default loan applications and, more importantly, can increase loan approval rate up to 8.8%, while keeping similar default rate comparing to baselines.

First, to make full use of the classified information hidden in credit data, we employ XGBoost to linearize and transform the original features into a high-dimensional sparse feature matrix. Second, to effectively process the transformed high-dimensional data and to discover the relationships between the features, a recently proposed graph-based neural network (forgeNet) model, which is good at addressing high-dimensional data, is deployed to predict the credit risk. The real-world credit data of the Lending Club for the period from 2007 to 2016 were collected and partitioned based on the economic cycle to validate the robustness of the proposed model. The experimental results show that feature transformation and feature graph mining are two pragmatic processes for credit risk prediction when analyzing credit data.

The purpose of this research is to construct a hybrid predictive framework that integrates classification, feature selection, and data balance algorithms to cope with the high-dimensional and imbalanced nature of P2P credit data. Design/methodology/approach: An improved synthetic minority over-sampling technique (IMSMOTE) is developed to incorporate the randomness and probability into the traditional synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to enhance the quality of synthetic samples and the controllability of synthetic processes. IMSMOTE is then implemented along with the grey relational clustering (GRC) and the support vector machine (SVM) to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the P2P credit risks. To enhance the associativity and functionality of the algorithm, a dynamic selection approach is integrated with GRC and then fed in the SVM's process of parameter adaptive adjustment to select the optimal critical value. A quantitative model is constructed to recognize key criteria via multidimensional representativeness. Findings: A series of experiments based on real-world P2P data from Prosper Funding LLC demonstrates that our proposed model outperforms other existing approaches. It is also confirmed that the grey-based GRC approach with dynamic selection succeeds in reducing data dimensions, selecting a critical value, identifying key criteria, and IMSMOTE can efficiently handle the imbalanced data.

The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customer's sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens up the door of privacy leakage. A recently invented privacy-preserving distributed ML scheme referred to as Federated learning (FL) enables generating a target model without sharing local information through on-device model training on edge resources. In this paper, we propose an FL-based application to predict customers’ financial issues by constructing a global learning model that is evolved based on the local models of the distributed agents. The local models are generated by the network agents using their on-device data and local resources. We used the FL concept because the learning strategy does not require sharing any data with the server or any other agent that ensures the preservation of customers’ sensitive data. To that end, we enable partial works from the weak agents that eliminate the issue if the model convergence is retarded due to straggler agents. We also leverage asynchronous FL that cut off the extra waiting time during global model generation. We simulated the performance of our FL model considering a popular dataset, Give me Some Credit (Freshcorn, 2017). We evaluated our proposed method considering a a different number of stragglers and setting up various computational tasks (e.g., local epoch, batch size), and simulated the training loss and testing accuracy of the prediction model. Finally, we compared the F1-score of our proposed model with the existing centralized and decentralized approaches. Our results show that our proposed model achieves an almost identical F1-score as like centralized model even when we set up a skew-level of more than 80% and outperforms the state-of-the-art FL models by obtaining an average of 5∼6% higher accuracy when we have resource-constrained agents within a learning environment.",Federated learning | Financial distress | Global model | Local model | Model aggregation | On-device training,10,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,FIU,undefined,Florida International University

It is a very critical element in credit risk analysis. Machine learning based classifiers have been heavily utilized in predicting bankruptcy. In terms of machine learning, predicting bankruptcy with imbalanced dataset is a very big challenge. Despite the current existing models for bankruptcy prediction, finding a model that achieves a high-performance measurement with imbalanced datasets is still an interesting point of research. The reason behind this challenge is the fact that imbalanced dataset leads to misclassification results. This paper aims to develop a robust machine learning based model for predicting bankruptcy with solving imbalanced dataset problem. Four different re-sampling strategies were applied to solve the imbalanced class distribution problem based on three popular datasets.

Credit ratings, as an approximate but important measure of corporate credit risks, have been widely used by investors, creditors, and supply chain partners in their decision-making. This study studies the role of supply chain information in predicting companies’ credit ratings. Using firm-level supplier–customer linkages and corporate credit rating data, we develop a machine learning framework with gradient boosted decision trees to examine whether and what supply chain features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of credit ratings, and what types of supply chain links have higher information content that positively affects the predictability of the supply chain features. We construct a firm's supply chain variables from its supplier and customer portfolios. We show that incorporating supply chain features can improve prediction accuracy over the benchmark credit rating model using only the focal firm's features. Moreover, the informativeness of supply chain links in focal credit risk prediction depends on the focal firm's industry sector, the relationship strength of such links, and the switching costs. Finally, we develop a focal credit rating prediction model with a high accuracy level using supply chain factors solely, which can potentially be applied to predict credit risks of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and private firms with no public financial information, as long as their supply chain information is available.",credit rating | credit risk | machine learning application | supply chains,16,0,,,CSC,undefined,China Scholarship Council

This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint).

Various studies have shown that heterogeneous ensemble models have received superior classification performances as compare to existing machine learning models. Enhancement in the predictive performance will result great savings of revenues for financial institution. And, in order to provide the higher stability and accuracy, ensemble learning produces commendable results due to their inherent properties for improving the effectiveness of credit scoring model. So, this study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of nine ensemble learning approaches such as Multiboost, Cross Validation Parameter, Random Subspace, Metacoast, etc. with five classification approaches such as Partial Decision Tree (PART), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes Decision Tree (NBT) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) along with various ensemble classifiers frameworks arranged in single and multi layer with various aggregation approaches such as Majority Voting, Average Probability, Maximum Probability, Unanimous Voting and Weighted Voting.

Its particular focus lies on the management of the model risk of productive models in banks and other financial institutions. The models in view range from simple rules-based approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine learning (ML) models with a high level of sophistication. The typical applications of those models are related to predictions and decision making around the value chain of credit risk (including accounting side under IFRS9 or related national GAAP approaches), insurance risk or other financial risk types. We expect more models of higher complexity in the space of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and transaction monitoring as well as a rise of AI/ML models as alternatives to current methods in solving some of the more intricate stochastic differential equations needed for the pricing and/or valuation of derivatives. The same type of model is also successful in areas unrelated to risk management, such as sales optimization, customer lifetime value considerations, robo-advisory, and other fields of applications. The paper refers to recent related publications from central banks, financial supervisors and regulators as well as other relevant sources and working groups. It aims to give practical advice for establishing a risk-based governance and testing framework for the mentioned model types and discusses the use of recent technologies, approaches, and platforms to support the establishment of responsible, trustworthy, explainable, auditable, and manageable AI/ML in production. In view of the recent EU publication on AI, also referred to as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), we also see a certain added value for this paper as an instigator of further thinking outside of the financial services sector, in particular where “High Risk” models according to the mentioned EU consultation are concerned.",artificial intelligence | EU AI act | explainable AI | financial regulation and compliance | machine learning | risk management,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,EC,825215,European Commission

Most of the techniques and algorithms used in this regard previously do not submit any attention to the uncertainty in predictions for out of distribution (OOD) in a dataset, which contributes to overfitting, leading to relatively lower accuracy for predicting these data points. Specifically, for credit risk classification, this is a serious concern, given the structure of the available datasets and the trend they follow. With a focus on this issue, we propose a robust and better methodology that uses a recent and efficient family of nonlinear neural network activation functions, which mimics the properties induced by the widely-used Matérn family of kernels in Gaussian process (GP) models.

This article explores from an interdisciplinary point of view the connection between existing legal requirements for the explainability of AI systems set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the current state of the art in the field of explainable AI. It studies the challenges of providing human legible explanations for current and future AI-based decision-making systems in practice, based on two scenarios of automated decision-making in credit scoring risks and medical diagnosis of COVID-19. These scenarios exemplify the trend towards increasingly complex machine learning algorithms in automated decision-making, both in terms of data and models. Current machine learning techniques, in particular those based on deep learning, are unable to make clear causal links between input data and final decisions. This represents a limitation for providing exact, human-legible reasons behind specific decisions, and presents a serious challenge to the provision of satisfactory, fair and transparent explanations. Therefore, the conclusion is that the quality of explanations might not be considered as an adequate safeguard for automated decision-making processes under the GDPR. Accordingly, additional tools should be considered to complement explanations. These could include algorithmic impact assessments, other forms of algorithmic justifications based on broader AI principles, and new technical developments in trustworthy AI.

First, from the perspective of signal costs, signaling theory is used to analyze the impacts of venture quality and extended level of uncertainty signals on LGD. Then, a new hybrid multilayer LGD model-based hierarchical framework is proposed for studying the LGD predictions of commercial banks in a highdimensional unbalanced data context. The experimental results demonstrate that the venture quality and level of uncertainty significantly affect LGD. Additionally, the hybrid multilayer LGD model – consisting of logistic classification, random oversampling examples combined with random forest classification and ordinary least squares regression – not only yields high levels of prediction accuracy and interpretability in high-dimensional unbalanced data contexts but is also robust regardless of the selection of the training set and samples used.

Various traditional industries have produced some new industries after combining Internet technology. Since the beginning of the 21 st century, the connection between the Internet and the financial industry has become increasingly close, which has spawned a new financial model of Internet finance. P2P platform is one of them. Because its lending process is simple and convenient, and there is no strict loan application standard like traditional banks, it has been favored by many small and mediumsized enterprises. Various P2P platforms have mushroomed. However, the rapid development of P2P platforms has also brought security problems that cannot be ignored. This is largely due to the lack of adequate credit evaluation of borrowers before loans or the lack of accuracy of credit evaluation methods. Therefore, the accurate credit evaluation of the relevant lending data of the borrower has become the entry point for reducing the risk of borrowing. Considering that machine learning has been very mature in processing and analyzing data, and has many successful experiences, the CART classification tree model has the advantages of good effect, easy to understand, and less affected by outliers and missing values. It can also find fields that have important warning effects on the risk of borrowing, so this experiment uses the CART classification tree to train the data. Considering that only a single CART classification tree is used to analyze data, there is still room for improvement in analysis accuracy, so this model is optimized to use an Ensemble model to analyze data.

In the financial field, traditional banks cannot meet the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises with rapid growth. Thanks to the mature development of Internet platforms, various P2P(Peer to Peer Lending) platforms have emerged as the times require. They provide a simple reception approval process and provide investors and borrowers with convenient lending channels. However, with the rapid development of the P2P industry, P2P has frequent security problems. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the personal credit evaluation of the borrower is inaccurate, which leads to a chain reaction. Therefore, the effective estimation of the credit data of the borrower is the key to solving the credit risk. With the rapid development of machine learning, various risk prevention and control models are more and more accurate in predicting personal credit. However, default data accounts for only a small part of the massive credit data, so it is particularly important to process the data set, especially to balance the sample data. Traditionally, SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) algorithm is generally used for oversampling of data. However, when there are noise samples in the auxiliary samples of the samples synthesized by this algorithm, the new samples may become the noise sample interference model. In this paper, the Borderline-SMOTE algorithm is used to oversample the data features.

In this paper, we use Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques to produce inherently interpretable scoring systems under sparsity and fairness constraints, for the general multi-class classification setup. Our work generalizes the SLIM (Supersparse Linear Integer Models) framework that was proposed by Rudin and Ustun to learn optimal scoring systems for binary classification. The use of MILP techniques allows for an easy integration of diverse operational constraints (such as, but not restricted to, fairness or sparsity), but also for the building of certifiably optimal models (or sub-optimal models with bounded optimality gap).",Fairness | Interpretability | Machine Learning | Mixed-Integer Linear Programming | Multi-class Classification | Scoring System,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In our research work, we adopted a cascade of a pre-Trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to realize a loan eligibility model. An 11-layer DNN with a sigmoid output layer was trained with a loan credit dataset obtained from Kaggle and the output layer was removed which then makes SoftMax with 64 outputs a new output layer. The DNN is then used to transform the original 11-feature dataset into a 64-feature high dimension dataset. An SVM with a polynomial kernel was trained on the original dataset and achieved an accuracy of 87% but the same SVM achieved an accuracy of 97.05% when trained with the transformed high dimension dataset obtained from the pre-Trained DNN.

One upshot is that credit risk assessments must be explainable to the consumer. In the United States regulatory milieu, this entails both the identification of key factors in a decision and the provision of consistent actions that would improve standing. The traditionally accepted approach to explainable credit risk modeling involves generating scores with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) - usually logistic regression, calculating the contribution of each predictor to the total points lost from the theoretical maximum, and generating reason codes based on the 4 or 5 most impactful predictors. The industry standard approach is not directly applicable to a more expressive and flexible class of nonlinear models known as neural networks. This paper demonstrates that an eXplainable AI (XAI) variable attribution technique known as Integrated Gradients (IG) is a natural generalization of the industry standard to neural networks. We also discuss the unique semantics surrounding implementation details in this nonlinear context. While the primary purpose of this paper is to introduce IG to the credit industry and argue for its establishment as an industry standard, a secondary goal is to familiarize academia with the legislative constraints - including their historical and philosophical roots - and sketch the standard approach in the credit industry since there is a dearth of literature on the topic.",Credit Scoring | Explainable Artificial Intelligence | Fairness | Integrated Gradients | Machine Learning Deep Learning | Transparency | Trust,0,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

We evaluate by means of a literature review how sentiment dictionaries can be constructed for specific domains and languages. Then, we construct nine versions of German sentiment dictionaries relying on a process model which we developed based on the literature review. We apply the dictionaries to a manually classified German language data set from Twitter in which hints for financial (in)stability of companies have been proven. Based on their classification accuracy, we rank the dictionaries and verify their ranking by utilizing Mc Nemar's test for significance. Our results indicate, that the significantly best dictionary is based on the German language dictionary SentiWortschatz and an extension approach by use of the lexical-semantic database GermaNet. It achieves a classification accuracy of 59,19 % in the underlying three-case-scenario, in which the Tweets are labelled as negative, neutral or positive. A random classification would attain an accuracy of 33,3 % in the same scenario and hence, automated coding by use of the sentiment dictionaries can lead to a reduction of manual efforts.

Consumption data are an example of such a source, as they provide an overview of clients' spending habits. However, considering this information at a level of individual companies where clients' purchases took place inherently leads to sparse data, as customers typically shop at only a small subset of the available retailers.

This study benchmarked Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) based on their superior model accuracy performance in most previous studies. Consequently, this study aims to perform a comparative analysis of classification power between DNN and GBM. To date, there is no such comparison. Each model underwent extensive tuning to achieve performance appropriate for the comparison in this study. The author deployed three renowned credit risk datasets for model construction to train GBM, DNN + ReLU, DNN + Maxout, and DNN + Tanh classifiers. For the model evaluation, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC ROC) was utilized to assess the models' accuracy performance. The assessment also includes investigating the effect of splitting the training/test sets using the split method of 80:20 split and 70:30 split. The results indicate that GBM tends to be faster and more potent than DNN due to its lower processing requirements. GBM is hence the preferred method for credit scoring prediction. Overall, this study observed that DNN and GBM could be the cutting-edge for solving classification problems. Nevertheless, GBM should be the first-choice option due to its simplicity, quicker to train, and higher accuracy.",Credit Risk Prediction Accuracy | Deep Neural Network | Gradient Boosting Machines,1,0,,,PNU,undefined,Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University

Aiming at the problem of credit risk, on the basis of studying the methods of prevention and control of pre-loan risk, this paper uses various methods such as coding and variables to process credit data. The random forest method is integrated to select variables, and the weighted logistic regression method is used to construct a pre-loan risk early warning model, which can perceive credit risks in advance and give early warnings. On the basis of studying random forest algorithm and parameter optimization method, a post-loan risk early warning model based on random forest algorithm is designed; and the model parameters are optimized to make the risk early warning model have high accuracy.

Hence, it is widely acknowledged that having a proper strategy in place to manage and lessen the credit risks that these companies face is more beneficial, rather than relying on traditional manual techniques. This study is intended to propose a machine learning-based solution to predict possible financial lease defaults beforehand. The dataset used in this work was obtained from a leading finance company in Sri Lanka, where the data were related to leasing contracts and their equipment. According to the final results of this study, a deep learning model implemented using an Artificial Neural Network, which was compared against several other machine learning models, is the best to predict default lease cases in Sri Lankan financial institutions.

In this study, we propose a hybrid ensemble method that combines the advantages of the Bagging ensemble strategy and boosting ensemble optimization pattern, which can well balance the tradeoff of variance-bias optimization. The proposed method considers XGBoost as a base learner, which ensures the low-bias prediction. Moreover, the Bagging strategy is introduced to train the base learner to prevent over-fitting in the proposed method. Besides, the Bagging-boosting ensemble algorithm is further assembled in a cascading way, making the proposed new hybrid ensemble algorithm a good solution to balance the tradeoff of variance bias for credit scoring.

Recently, considering the relations among enterprises such as loan guarantee network, some graph-based models are applied in this field with the advent of graph neural networks. But these existing models build networks between corporations without taking the internal feature interactions into account. In this paper, to overcome such problems, we propose a novel model, Corporate Credit Rating via Graph Neural Networks, CCR-GNN for brevity.

Therefore, one of the principal challenges of financial institutions is to lower the losses generated by leading financial resources to possible default clients. Current models for Credit Risk Assessment used by the industry are based on Logistic regression (LR), thanks to their operational efficiency and interpretability. However, Deep Learning (DL) Algorithms have become more attractive than conventional Machine Learning due to their best general accuracy. However, Models for Credit Risk Assessment based on DL have a problem because their complexity makes them difficult for humans to interpret. Additionally, international regulations for financial institutions require that models be interpretable. In this work, we propose the use of a model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to generate a more accurate and explainable model than LR models.

Mamdani fuzzy systems can provide explanations based on their linguistic rules, and thus a potential pathway to XAI. A factual rule based explanation generally refers to the given set of rules executed, or fired, for a given input. However, research has shown that human explanations are often counterfactual (CF), i.e. rather than explaining why a given output was reached, they show why other potential outputs were not. Although several machine learning-based CF explanation generation methods have been proposed in recent years, quasi none of them focus on fuzzy systems. Also, where they do, they focus on correlation, which limits the interpretive value of any CF explanations obtained as humans expect a causal relationship in rules, i.e. we are cause-effect thinkers. In this paper, we propose a new rule generation framework for Mamdani fuzzy classification systems, which we refer to as CF-MABLAR, building on the MARkov BLAnket Rules (MABLAR) framework. CF-MABLAR approximates the causal links between inputs and output(s) of fuzzy systems and generates CF rules by leveraging them. Uniquely, the CF rules obtained not only provide a basic CF explanation, but can also articulate how the given inputs would need to be changed to generate a different output, crucial for lay-user insight, verification and sensitivity-evaluation of XAI systems, for example in decision support around credit risk, cyber security and medical assistance.",causal | counterfactual | explanation | Fuzzy | rule,1,0,,,EPSRC,EP/P011918/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

A common method is to use the greedy strategy to generate an interpretable rule set to classify all the users into high-risk or non-risk users. During each iteration, the greedy strategy utilizes a pre-defined indicator function to evaluate which rule is the best and then adds it to the rule set. However, in reality, the indicator function is designed manually and requires much domain knowledge and expert experience. Worse still, we need to design a suitable indicator for every situation, which is tedious and time-consuming work. This motivates us to propose a self-adaptive indicator that can be adapted to different situations without too much human intervention. In this paper, we see the indicator as a weighted sum of several sub-indicators. By tuning the weights, the indicator can be adapted to different situations automatically. That is, we transform this indicator selection problem into a weights tuning problem. To find the best weight of self-adaptive indicators, machine learning methods and black-box optimization are utilized. The experimental results demonstrated that our self-adaptive indicator can select a better rule set to identify more high-risk users compared to the human-defined indicator.",black-box optimization | credit risk assessment | indicator selection | machine learning,0,0,,,,2022CDJXY-022,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities

In this work, we define a formal framework for the fairness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning decision models, where we adopt one of the most popular notions of fairness in the literature based on the intuition—any two similar individuals must be treated similarly and are thus unbiased. We show that quantum noise can improve fairness and develop an algorithm to check whether a (noisy) quantum machine learning model is fair. In particular, this algorithm can find bias kernels of quantum data (encoding individuals) during checking. These bias kernels generate infinitely many bias pairs for investigating the unfairness of the model. Our algorithm is designed based on a highly efficient data structure—Tensor Networks—and implemented on Google’s TensorFlow Quantum.

Application scoring models for potential customers usually perform worse than models for existing customers.

Open banking application programming interfaces (APIs) provide access to 90 days of historical data on potential customers’ balances and transactions. We examine the performance of credit scoring models developed using such data from a Norwegian bank. We find that traditional regression models perform poorly, while machine learning (ML) methods can provide models that perform satisfactorily based on these data alone. Further, we find that the best performing models are based on an end-to-end deep learning approach, where machine learning algorithms create explanatory variables based on non-aggregated data. These results indicate that data available through the open banking APIs can be an important data source when banks assess the creditworthiness of potential customers.

When a financial institution wants to build a model to predict the default of credit applicants, the institution only has a known good/bad outcome loan status for the accepted applicants; this causes an inherent bias in the model. Reject inference is used to infer the good or bad loan status of credit applicants that were rejected by a financial institution. This paper presents a reject inference technique in which a semi-supervised framework is developed using a Naive Bayes model. The framework uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to incorporate rejected applicants into the parameter estimation of the model using a bootstrapping approach. The proposed method has an advantage over traditional reject inference methods because the rejected applicant data will participate in the estimation of the model parameters, thus avoiding the extrapolation problem.

In doing so, this paper proposes a credit risk feature selection approach that integrates the binary opposite whale optimization algorithm (BOWOA) and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic. Furthermore, we use seven machine learning classifiers and three discriminant methods to verify the robustness of the proposed model by using three actual bank data from SMEs.

Their superior accuracy compared to parametric model alternatives has been demonstrated repeatedly in the literature. However, the statistical independence of the data implicitly assumed by resampling-based error estimates is unlikely to hold in a real estate context as price-formation processes in property markets are inherently spatial, which leads to spatial dependence structures in the data. When performing conventional cross-validation techniques for model selection and model assessment, spatial dependence between training and test data may lead to undetected overfitting and overoptimistic perception of predictive power. This study sheds light on the bias in cross-validation errors of tree-based algorithms induced by spatial autocorrelation and proposes a bias-reduced spatial cross-validation strategy. The findings confirm that error estimates from non-spatial resampling methods are overly optimistic, whereas spatially conscious techniques are more dependable and can increase generalizability. As accurate and unbiased error estimates are crucial to automated valuation methods, our results prove helpful for applications including, but not limited to, mass appraisal, credit risk management, portfolio allocation and investment decision making.",Automated valuation models | Hedonic modeling | Machine learning | Mass appraisal | Spatial autocorrelation | Spatial cross-validation,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

The spiking classifier is a multiclass synaptic efficacy function-based leaky-integrate-fire neuron (Mc-SEFRON) classifier. As a first step, the SEFRON classifier for binary classification is extended to handle multiclass classification problems. Next, a new method is presented to transform the temporally distributed weights in a fully trained Mc-SEFRON classifier to shape functions in the feature space. A composite of these shape functions results in an interpretable classifier, namely, a directly interpretable multiclass additive model (DIMA). The interpretations of DIMA are also demonstrated using the multiclass Iris dataset. Further, the performances of both the Mc-SEFRON and DIMA classifiers are evaluated on ten benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and compared with the other state-of-the-art spiking neural classifiers. The performance study results show that Mc-SEFRON produces similar or better performances than other spiking neural classifiers with an added benefit of interpretability through DIMA. Furthermore, the minor differences in accuracies between Mc-SEFRON and DIMA indicate the reliability of the DIMA classifier. Finally, the Mc-SEFRON and DIMA are tested on three real-world credit scoring problems, and their performances are compared with state-of-the-art results using machine learning methods. The results clearly indicate that DIMA improves the classification accuracy by up to 12% over other interpretable classifiers indicating a better quality of interpretations on the highly imbalanced credit scoring datasets.",Additive model | credit scoring | interpretable classifier | knowledge transform | spiking neural network | time-varying weight model,1,0,,,,undefined,

Adoption of AI/ML technologies are transforming credit process by significantly reducing the risk by predicting loan defaults. Data Science has paved the way for enabling predictive analytics. Several data science techniques such as Logistic regression, SVM, Neural Networks, Random Forest are discussed in this paper on how they enable increasing the accuracy of predicting loan defaulters. This paper deals with how a credit score is predicted to help financial institutions set the terms of loan disbursements to their customers. The focus of this paper is to present a loan prediction solution-Seven Seas to financial institutions. Several aspects of loan origination have been dealt with in this paper. A high-level process of loan application and an alternative credit scoring model using Machine Learning has been described. This paper also entails the overall market scope for such a solution and identifies several financial institutions that can embark on their transformation initiatives with such a disruptive technology.

Currently, the use of technology for credit score is not universally adopted by financial institutions because there is lack of evidence to ensure the effectiveness of this alternate method. Thus, the aim of this research is to recognize the impact or effect on the financial institutions which they have experienced post integrating AI in their institution for generating credit scores for the lending process. The data was collected from 68 Credit officers/Credit Managers working in Financial Services Provider companies. The semi structured questionnaire was used to understand the use of AI and the perception of Credit Managers towards using AI in the lending process. The primary and secondary data were analysed to evaluate the impact of using AI in calculating Credit score. The research suggested that the financial institutions consider time saving with lesser workforce, Increase in Revenues and Business, Default rate reduction and Skill upgrade along with not breaching privacy of their customers.

Advanced analytics can predict the probability that an event will happen and has been applied to pressing industry issues, such as credit scoring, risk management, and default management. Although little research has applied such technique for lot sizing problems, we observe that advanced analytics can uncover optimal patterns of setup variables given properties associated with the problems, such as problem attributes, and solution values yielded by linear programming relaxation, column generation, and Lagrangian relaxation. We, therefore, build advanced analytics models that yield information about how likely a solution pattern is the same as the optimum, which is insightful information used to partition the solution space into incumbent, superincumbent, and nonincumbent regions where an analytics-driven heuristic search procedure is applied to build restricted subproblems. These subproblems are solved by a combined mathematical programming technique to improve solution quality iteratively. We prove that the predictive search method can converge to the global optimal solution point. The discussion is followed by computational tests, where comparisons with other methods indicate that our approach can obtain better results for the benchmark problems than other state-of-the-art methods.

The performance of the default prediction is evaluated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve using three types of kernels, namely, the polynomial kernel, the linear kernel and the Gaussian kernel. To justify the performance of the model, the study compares the prediction of default by the support vector with the logistic regression using data from a portfolio of particular bank customers. The results of this study showed that the model based on the Support Vector Machine approach with the Radial Basis Function kernel, performs better in prediction, compared to the logistic regression model, with a value of the ROC curve equal to 98%, against 71.7% for the logistic regression model.

In this work, we find that the default/non-default classification task and the rejection/approval classification task are highly correlated, according to both real-world data study and theoretical analysis.

RMT-Net leverages the relation between the two tasks that the larger the rejection probability, the more the default/non-default task needs to learn from the rejection/approval task. Furthermore, we extend RMT-Net to RMT-Net++ for modeling scenarios with multiple rejection/approval strategies. Extensive experiments are conducted on several datasets, and strongly verifies the effectiveness of RMT-Net on both approved and rejected samples.

Credit risk can harm a lender by increasing collection costs and causing cash flow inconsistency. Lenders use credit risk modelling to assess the amount of credit risk associated with lending credit to borrowers. Financial statement analysis, default likelihood and machine learning are the options for credit risk analysis models. And, solving this kind of problem using machine learning techniques is known as credit risk modelling. In this process, we fit data having loads of features related to the financial conditions of a person into the model to classify a lender as a defaulter or non-defaulter. In this study, we used an unsupervised machine learning technique for this task. First, we applied two feature selection methods, viz. using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient and chi-square test, to select certain features which are less informative for the task. Feature selection is one of the pre-processing standards in designing advanced solutions because it does not only alleviate dataset dimensions but also improves a model’s performance measures. We also applied the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to get the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of all the selected features, as supplementary and artificial feature vectors to the model. To deal with class imbalance, we used a specific variant of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), i.e. Gaussian-SMOTE. Finally, we applied Gaussian mixture model (GMM) at distinct values for its parameters like the ‘covariance type’. With this and the optimally selected parameters, our methodology was able to achieve a classification accuracy of 85.48%.",Credit risk modelling | Discrete Fourier transform | Feature selection | Gaussian mixture model | Gaussian-SMOTE | Unsupervised machine learning,0,0,,,ICSSR,undefined,Indian Council of Social Science Research

One such domain is credit scoring, where applicants are scored to assess their creditworthiness for loan applications. It is essential to ensure that no biases or discriminations are incurred during the scoring process. Most machine learning and deep learning models are prone to unintended bias and discrimination in the datasets. Therefore, it is imperative to explain each prediction from the models during the scoring process to avoid the element of model bias and discrimination. Our study proposes a novel optimization formulation that generates sparse counterfactual explanations via a custom genetic algorithm to explain the black-box model's predictions.

Primarily, the DNN model receives the financial data as input and predicts financial distress. In addition, the AWOA is applied to tune the DNN model's hyperparameters, thereby raising the predictive outcome. The proposed model is applied in three stages: preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning using AWOA, and the prediction phase.

Many of these applications suffer from the problem of Imbalanced data classification wherein one class consists of a large number of samples while samples representing another class are very less in number. The skewed nature of data results in the imprecise classification of the data which may be very harmful in some disciplines like medical applications. To highlight the class imbalance issue, this work presents the impact of the increased degree of class imbalance on the classification performance of various datasets.

As a result, the current guidelines’ requirement for “interpretability from the start” is not met. As a result, such methods are only useful as a sanity check after the model has been trained. In an abstract scenario, “interpretability from the start” implies imposing a set of soft constraints on the model’s behavior by infusing knowledge and eliminating any biases. By inserting knowledge into the objective function, we present a Multicriteria technique that allows us to control the feature effects on the model’s output. To accommodate for more complex effects and local lack of information, we enhance the method by integrating particular knowledge functions. As a result, a Deep Learning training process that is both interpretable and compliant with modern legislation has been developed.

Most banks employ their credit scoring and risk assessment procedures to examine loan applications and make credit approval decisions. Despite this, many incidents of people failing to repay loans or defaulting on them occur every year, causing financial institutions to lose a significant amount of money. In this study, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to extract patterns from a common loan-approved dataset and retrieve patterns in forecasting future loan defaulters. Customers' past data, such as their age, income, loan amount, and tenure of work, will be used to conduct the analysis. To determine the maximum relevant features, i.e. the factors that have the most impact on the prediction outcome, various ML algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression, were used.

While definitions of fairness in philosophy are varied, mitigating bias in ML classifiers often relies on demographic parity-based constraints across sub-populations. However, enforcing such constraints blindly can lead to undesirable trade-offs between group-level accuracy if groups possess different underlying sampled population metrics, an occurrence that is surprisingly common in real-world applications like credit risk and income classification. Similarly, attempts to relax hard constraints may lead to unintentional degradation in classification performance, without benefit to any demographic group. In these increasingly likely scenarios, we make the case for transparent human intervention in making the trade-offs between the accuracies of demographic groups. We propose that transparency in trade-offs between demographic groups should be a key tenet of ML design and implementation.

To make the credit scoring model more adaptable to imbalanced datasets, the original model-based synthetic sampling method is extended herein to balance the datasets by generating appropriate minority samples to alleviate class overlap. To enable the credit scoring model to extract inherent correlations from features, a new bagging-based feature transformation method is proposed, which transforms features using a tree-based algorithm and selects features using the chi-square statistic. Furthermore, a two-layer ensemble method that combines the advantages of dynamic ensemble selection and stacking is proposed to improve the classification performance of the proposed multi-stage ensemble model. Finally, four standardized datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model using six evaluation metrics.

Combined, the use of AI and big data can capture weak signals, whether in the form of interactions or non-linearities between explanatory variables that appear to yield prediction improvements over conventional measures of creditworthiness. At the macroeconomic level, this translates into positive estimates for economic growth. On a micro scale, instead, the use of AI in credit analysis improves financial inclusion and access to credit for traditionally underserved borrowers. However, AI-based credit analysis processes raise enduring concerns due to potential biases and ethical, legal, and regulatory problems.

Even when the forecasting was constrained to the investment grades, speculative grades, or default categories, the accuracy remained robust. The results also suggest that a random forest ensemble can be used alongside the regression trees in order to predict default or near default ratings.

Significant potential is therefore missed, leading to higher reserves or more credit defaults. This article works out different dimensions that have to be considered for making credit scoring models understandable and presents a framework for making “black box” machine learning models transparent, auditable, and explainable. Following this framework, we present an overview of techniques, demonstrate how they can be applied in credit scoring and how results compare to the interpretability of scorecards.

We give a general background on LIME then, we focus on the stability issue: employing the method repeated times, under the same conditions, may yield to different explanations. Two complementary indices are proposed, to measure LIME stability. It is important for the practitioner to be aware of the issue, as well as to have a tool for spotting it. Stability guarantees LIME explanations to be reliable therefore a stability assessment, made through the proposed indices, is crucial.

This paper applies CR Rsf to the financial dataset which involves two competing credit risks: default and early repayment. This application yields two novel findings. First, CR Rsf dominates, in terms of prediction accuracy, the state of art model in survival analysis-Cox proportional hazard model for competing risks. Second, ignoring the competing risk event of early repayment results in an upwardly-biased estimate of the cumulative probability of default.

Such loss of faith among investors and criticism toward the rating agencies were especially severe during the financial crisis in 2008. To overcome this issue, several alternatives are addressed; in particular, the focus is on elaborating a rating model for Moody’s long-term companies’ ratings for industrial and retailing firms that could be useful as an external check of published rates.

Thus, the main aim of this paper is to help bank management in scoring credit card clients using machine learning by modelling and predicting the consumer behaviour with respect to two aspects: the probability of single and consecutive missed payments for credit card customers. The proposed model is based on the bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to give the probability of a missed payment during the next month for each customer. The model was trained on a real credit card dataset and the customer behavioural scores are analysed using classical measures such as accuracy, Area Under the Curve, Brier score, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and H-measure. Calibration analysis of the LSTM model scores showed that they can be considered as probabilities of missed payments.

It can not only help institutions reduce risk and ensure profitability, but also improve consumers’ fair practices. The data-driven algorithms such as artificial intelligence techniques regard the evaluation as a classification problem and aim to classify transactions as default or non-default. Since non-default samples greatly outnumber default samples, it is a typical imbalanced learning problem and each class or each sample needs special treatment. Numerous data-level, algorithm-level and hybrid methods are presented, and cost-sensitive support vector machines (CSSVMs) are representative algorithm-level methods. Based on the minimization of symmetric and unbounded loss functions, CSSVMs impose higher penalties on the misclassification costs of minority instances using domain specific parameters. However, such loss functions as error measurement cannot have an obvious cost-sensitive generalization. In this paper, we propose a robust cost-sensitive kernel method with Blinex loss (CSKB), which can be applied in credit risk evaluation. By inheriting the elegant merits of Blinex loss function, i.e., asymmetry and boundedness, CSKB not only flexibly controls distinct costs for both classes, but also enjoys noise robustness. As a data-driven decision-making paradigm of credit risk evaluation, CSKB can achieve the “win-win” situation for both the financial institutions and consumers. We solve linear and nonlinear CSKB by Nesterov accelerated gradient algorithm and Pegasos algorithm respectively. Moreover, the generalization capability of CSKB is theoretically analyzed. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic, UCI and credit risk evaluation datasets demonstrate that CSKB compares more favorably than other benchmark methods in terms of various measures.",Blinex loss function | Cost-sensitive support vector machine | Credit risk evaluation | Imbalanced learning,10,0,,,NSFC,11901401,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Among them, credit risk assessment is a major application of machine learning for financial institutions to evaluate credit of users and detect default or fraud. Simple white-box models, such as Logistic Regression (LR), are usually used for credit risk assessment, but not powerful enough to model complex nonlinear interactions among features. In contrast, complex black-box models are powerful at modeling, but lack of interpretability, especially global interpretability. Fortunately, automatic feature crossing is a promising way to find cross features to make simple classifiers to be more accurate without heavy handcrafted feature engineering. However, existing automatic feature crossing methods have problems in efficiency on credit risk assessment, for corresponding data usually contains hundreds of feature fields. In this work, we find local interpretations in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) of a specific feature are usually inconsistent among different samples. We demonstrate this is caused by nonlinear feature interactions in the hidden layers of DNN. Thus, we can mine feature interactions in DNN, and use them as cross features in LR. This will result in mining cross features more efficiently. Accordingly, we propose a novel automatic feature crossing method called DNN2LR. The final model, which is a LR model empowered with cross features, generated by DNN2LR is a white-box model. We conduct experiments on both public and business datasets from real-world credit risk assessment applications, which show that, DNN2LR outperform both conventional models used for credit assessment and several feature crossing methods. Moreover, comparing with state-of-the-art feature crossing methods, i.e., AutoCross, the proposed DNN2LR method accelerates the speed by about 10 to 40 times on financial credit assessment datasets, which contain hundreds of feature fields.",automated machine learning | credit risk assessment | default prediction | feature crossing | interpretability,4,0,,,,undefined,

In these problems, the ability to explain how the individual features and their interactions affect the decisions is as critical as model performance. Unfortunately, the existing ordinal regression models in the machine learning community aim at improving prediction accuracy rather than explore explainability. To achieve high accuracy while explaining the relationships between the features and the predictions, we propose a new method for ordinal regression problems, namely the Explainable Ordinal Factorization Model (XOFM). XOFM uses piecewise linear functions to approximate the shape functions of individual features, and renders the pairwise features interaction effects as heat-maps. The proposed XOFM captures the nonlinearity in the main effects and ensures the interaction effects' same flexibility. Therefore, the underlying model yields comparable performance while remaining explainable by explicitly describing the main and interaction effects. To address the potential sparsity problem caused by discretizing the whole feature scale into several sub-intervals, XOFM integrates the Factorization Machines (FMs) to factorize the model parameters. Comprehensive experiments with benchmark real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed XOFM leads to state-of-the-art prediction performance while preserving an easy-to-understand explainability.",decision support | explainable machine learning | factorization machines | Ordinal regression,2,0,,,NSFC,MHP/081/19,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The proposed scheme augments consumer profiles by incorporating phone usage information to alleviate the “thin file” challenge and enhance the predictive model by taking a multi-staged view of consumers' repayment timing to achieve a more finely grained credit risk determination. A three-step analysis, including prediction evaluation, model interpretation using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), and welfare analysis, was performed to evaluate our proposed scheme's efficacy.

MeST is developed to handle the class imbalance in classification problems without any data preprocessing methods. Meta-neuron based learning algorithm in MeST uses normalized postsynaptic potentials (global information) and weight of the connection (local information) to determine the sensitivity modulation factor. This modulation factor determines the proportion of the weight update for a given set of presynaptic spikes. The weight update is then embedded in a Gaussian function to determine the time-varying weight update. The centre of the time-varying Gaussian function is determined by the presynaptic spike times. MeST is demonstrated on 10 benchmark datasets from the University of California, Irvine California machine learning repository and then applied to solve credit scoring using three real-world datasets. Performance studies show that the generalization ability of MeST is better than other spiking neural networks with constant weight model, despite having a simple architecture. Furthermore, compared to other non-spiking shallow machine learning classifiers, MeST is a slightly better model for classification using highly imbalanced datasets. This indicates the learnability of a stand-alone classifier on an imbalanced dataset can be increased by using time-varying weights.",Class imbalance | Credit scoring | Spiking neural network | Supervised learning | Time-varying weight model,3,0,,,A*STAR,undefined,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research"

Techniques such as extreme gradient boosting, random forest and support vector machines are challenging to interpret. This restricts the commercial application of these techniques as they lack transparency and often hide potential biases inherited by the machine learning algorithms. Ultimately, this further limits the ability of these techniques to assess an individual's ability to pay for a loan. The biases lead to credit applications being rejected or individuals being offered ""unfair""credit terms based on their credit risk. Recently there have been attempts to predict credit default risk in literature. However, the majority of studies are conducted using data from developed countries, where most individuals are banked and data is complete. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and compare statistical classification techniques and machine learning techniques, with the focus being on interpreting the results and explaining which features contribute to the credit approval processes that may excel in both developed and developing countries. To achieve this goal, we explored three datasets from FinTech organisations, namely Home Credit, Xente, and Super Lender. Two of the datasets are from Uganda and Nigeria (developing countries in Africa) and one from the USA (a developed country in North America). We adopted Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to interpret the models. Using SHAP, we identified that for all three datasets, the external ratings, total due and loan duration increase the likelihood of an individual defaulting on a loan. Additionally, we also found that the tree-based algorithms, particularly the extreme gradient boosting algorithm outperforms logistic regression, random forest and other statistical learning techniques.",Credit risk | Developing countries | Finance | Financial technology | Interpretability | Machine learning,2,0,,,,undefined,

Although credit scoring has drawn much research interest and the superiority of ensemble models over single machine learning models has been proven, the question of which ensemble model is the best discrimination method for Chinese P2P lending services has received little attention. This study aims to conduct credit scoring by focusing on a Chinese P2P lending platform and selecting the optimal subset of features in order to find the best overall ensemble model. We propose a hybrid system to achieve these goals. Three feature selection algorithms are employed and combined to obtain the top 10 features. Six ensemble models with five base classifiers are then used to conduct comparisons after synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) treatment of the imbalanced data set. A real-world data set of 33 966 loans from the largest lending platform in China (ie, the Renren lending platform) is used to evaluate performance. The results show that the top 10 selected features can greatly improve performance compared with all features, particularly in terms of discriminating “bad” loans from “good” loans. Moreover, comparing the standard evaluations, robustness tests and statistical tests suggests that the gradient boosting decision tree, random forest and rotation forest methods are the best.

Traditionally CSM is built by logit model or decision tree algorithm in financial companies, and in recent studies CSM has been integrated with machine learning algorithms such as random forest and gradient boosting to process a number of complex attributes of customer borrowers. On the other hand, CSM has been facing a critical challenge - the domain adaptation of customer borrowers. For domain adaptation problem, transfer learning techniques are generally utilized, however, it is quite difficult to execute precise predictions for unknown domain datasets in CSM because the distributions of labels could be different depending on the characteristics of domains. Therefore, there is no appropriate transfer learning method to solve domain adaptation problem in credit scoring.

Wide opportunities for AI are seen in tasks associated with credit scoring. However, the expected potential and benefits of AI-based credit scoring and the overall path to digitalised lending could be challenged by the fact that a relatively large number of SMEs in Europe are credit invisible due to their financing patterns, that limit the availability of credit history and other creditworthiness sensitive data needed to build and train AI models. The research aims to estimate the nature and availability of credit scoring relevant SMEs data in different European countries. Research methods respective to the above-stated aim are the following: scientific literature review, descriptive, and country to country comparative analysis of the data from the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE). The survey data indicate that the share of credit invisible SMEs changes in the range of 1030%, but there is no direct relationship with the characteristics of the country. The initiatives to score the creditworthiness of SMEs should consider the share of SMEs that do not use services of the traditional financing sector, which means that data about its creditworthiness are limited. The whole population of SMEs could be covered by AI models incorporating both conventional financial data from credit visible SMEs processed by machine learning as well as unstructured non-financial data (describing credit invisible SMEs) processed by deep learning techniques and methods. Thus, we claim that despite the huge potential of AI incorporation into creditworthiness evaluation, the use of AI is not a magic pill, enhancing easier SME's access to finance, unless its use is aligned to the available data. Accordingly to the accessible data, different AI tools and techniques should be applied in credit scoring applications.",artificial intelligence | creditworthiness | digital lending | SMEs credit scoring,1,0,,,,undefined,

Machine learning is used in process automation, security, underwriting and credit scoring, algorithmic trading and robo-advisory. In fact, machine learning AI applications are purported to save banks an estimated $447 billion by 2023. Given the advantages that AI brings to finance, we focused on applying supervised machine learning to an investment problem. 10-K SEC filings are routinely used by investors to determine the worth and status of a company–Warren Buffett is frequently cited to read a 10-K a day. We sought to answer–“Can machine learning analyze more than thousands of companies and spot patterns? Can machine learning automate the process of human analysis in predicting whether a company is fit to merge? Can machine learning spot something that humans cannot?” In the advent of rising antitrust discussion of growing market concentrations and the concern for decrease in competition, we analyzed merger activity using text as a data set. Merger activity has been traditionally hard to predict in the past. We took advantage of the large amount of publicly available filings through the Securities Exchange Commission that give a comprehensive summary of a company, and used text, and an innovative way to analyze a company. In order to verify existing theory and measure harder to observe variables, we look to use a text document and examined a firm’s 10-K SEC filing. To minimize over-fitting, the L2 LASSO regularization technique is used. We came up with a model that has 85% accuracy compared to a 35% accuracy using the “bag-of-words” method to predict a company’s likelihood of merging from words alone on the same period’s test data set. These steps are the beginnings of tackling more complicated questions, such as “Which section or topic of words is the most predictive?” and “What is the difference between being acquired and acquiring?” Using product descriptions to characterize mergers further into horizontal and vertical mergers could eventually assist with the causal estimates that are of interest to economists. More importantly, using language and words to categorize companies could be useful in predicting counterfactual scenarios and answering policy questions, and could have different applications ranging from detecting fraud to better trading.",finance | machine learning | mergers and acquisations | supervised training | text,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

The final article base consisted of 41 papers and 2 book chapters, 53% of which were published in the top quartile journals in their field. Results are presented in a timeline according to the publication date and categorised by time slots. Credit risk assessment and stress testing are highlighted topics as well as other risk perspectives, with some references to ML application surveys. The most relevant ML techniques encompass k-nearest neigh-bours (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), tree-based models, ensembles, boosting techniques, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Recent trends include developing early warning systems (EWS) for bankruptcy and refining stress testing. One limitation of this study is the paucity of contributions using supervisory data, which justifies the need for additional investigation in this field.

There are at least three key insights that emerge from surveying the literature. First, as far as individual classifiers are concerned, linear classification methods often display a performance that is at least as good as that of machine learning methods. Second, ensemble methods tend to outperform individual classifiers. However, a dominant ensemble method cannot be easily identified in the empirical literature.

This is a classical problem of classification with imbalanced samples, where bad loans only take a small proportion of all applications. Various machine learning techniques have been applied to the prediction of default in the past few decades. In this paper, we aim to capture those early defaulted borrowers who are likely to be fraudsters on the online lending platform by using a multi-layer structured Gradient Boosted Decision Trees with Light Gradient Boosting Machines (ML-LightGBM). Due to the extremely imbalanced sample distribution and the costs of misclassification, we further apply a cost-sensitive framework to the loss function of classification models, in order to improve predictive accuracy. The empirical results, based on a sample of 1.6 million online loans, show that the proposed cost-sensitive ML-LightGBM algorithm outperforms other predictive models. This suggests that the cost-sensitive based ML-LightGBM is a promising technique for fraud detection and credit scoring.",Credit scoring | Early default | Ensemble learning | Fraud detection | Imbalanced classification,17,0,,,NSSFC,19ZDA092,National Social Science Fund of China

Yet, inevitably costs are involved with delegating power to algorithmically based systems, some of whose workings are opaque and unobservable and thus termed the “black box”. Central to understanding the “black box” is to acknowledge that the algorithm is not mendaciously undertaking this action; it is simply using the recombination afforded to scaled computable machine learning algorithms. But an algorithm with arbitrary precision can easily reconstruct those characteristics and make life-changing decisions, particularly in financial services (credit scoring, risk assessment, etc.), and it could be difficult to reconstruct, if this was done in a fair manner reflecting the values of society. If we permit AI to make life-changing decisions, what are the opportunity costs, data trade-offs, and implications for social, economic, technical, legal, and environmental systems? We find that over 160 ethical AI principles exist, advocating organisations to act responsibly to avoid causing digital societal harms. This maelstrom of guidance, none of which is compulsory, serves to confuse, as opposed to guide. We need to think carefully about how we implement these algorithms, the delegation of decisions and data usage, in the absence of human oversight and AI governance.

Additionally, we propose a general version of this loss function applying aggregation operators in order to improve performance by dealing with dataset shift via fuzzy logic.

The rapid growth of data collection and linking capabilities combined with the increasing diversity of the data-driven AI techniques, including machine learning (ML), has brought both ubiquitous opportunities for data analytics projects and increased demands for the regulation and accountability of the outcomes of these projects. As a result, the area of interpretability and explainability of ML is gaining significant research momentum. While there has been some progress in the development of ML methods, the methodological side has shown limited progress. This limits the practicality of using ML in the health domain: the issues with explaining the outcomes of ML algorithms to medical practitioners and policy makers in public health has been a recognized obstacle to the broader adoption of data science approaches in this domain. This study builds on the earlier work which introduced CRISP-ML, a methodology that determines the interpretability level required by stakeholders for a successful real-world solution and then helps in achieving it. CRISP-ML was built on the strengths of CRISP-DM, addressing the gaps in handling interpretability. Its application in the Public Healthcare sector follows its successful deployment in a number of recent real-world projects across several industries and fields, including credit risk, insurance, utilities, and sport. This study elaborates on the CRISP-ML methodology on the determination, measurement, and achievement of the necessary level of interpretability of ML solutions in the Public Healthcare sector. It demonstrates how CRISP-ML addressed the problems with data diversity, the unstructured nature of data, and relatively low linkage between diverse data sets in the healthcare domain. The characteristics of the case study, used in the study, are typical for healthcare data, and CRISP-ML managed to deliver on these issues, ensuring the required level of interpretability of the ML solutions discussed in the project. The approach used ensured that interpretability requirements were met, taking into account public healthcare specifics, regulatory requirements, project stakeholders, project objectives, and data characteristics.

In order to better meet the application of the model in real life, the enterprise loan mode is introduced, and the risk assessment of each loan mode is carried out according to the actual situation. Finally, the fuzzy neural network model is introduced. The enterprise loan mode and three secondary indicators are taken as the input of the fuzzy neural network. Finally, a three-level index: loan risk assessment is obtained. Using Python program to preprocess the data, the original indicators in the given materials are extracted as the first level indicators, and then on the basis of the first level indicators, the main factor analysis and other methods are used to analyze the characteristics and scoring of the second level indicators. Then, the entropy weight is established to obtain the higher-level index loan tendency, and the loan propensity and enterprise reputation are used as parameters to establish the decision-making Model, step by step to get the bank's quota allocation, interest rate, and finally get the bank allocation plan.

Companies typically respond to late payments from their customers by delaying payments to suppliers, thus generating a ripple through the transaction network. Therefore, trade credit is as a potential vehicle of propagation of losses in case of default events. The goal of this work is to leverage information on the trade credit among connected firms to predict imminent defaults of firms. We use a unique dataset of client firms of a major Italian bank to investigate firm bankruptcy between October 2016 to March 2018. We develop a model to capture network spillover effects originating from the supply chain on the probability of default of each firm via a sequential approach: the output of a first model component on single firm features is used in a subsequent model which captures network spillovers. While the first component is the standard econometrics way to predict such dynamics, the network module represents an innovative way to look into the effect of trade credit on default probability. This module looks at the transaction network of the firm, as inferred from the payments transiting via the bank, in order to identify the trade partners of the firm. By using several features extracted from the network of transactions, this model is able to predict a large fraction of the defaults, thus showing the value hidden in the network information. Finally, we merge firm and network features with a machine learning model to create a ‘hybrid’ model, which improves the recall for the task by almost 20 percentage points over the baseline.",,7,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

However, banks and credit platforms must consider practical issues such as their own capital costs and risk assessment while they help small and medium-sized enterprises reduce financing costs. This paper aims to study and design a credit risk assessment system based on big data technology and machine learning algorithms. It is hoped that the system will enhance the bank's ability to identify the credit risks of small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, it will reduce the bank's own bad loan ratio and increase profit margins. Achieving a win-win situation for small and medium-sized enterprises and banks, it's crucial to promote jointly the development of economy.",big data technology | credit risk assessment | machine learning algorithm,1,0,,,NSFC,2020KJJH039,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The prevalence of machine learning techniques has raised concerns about the potential for learned algorithms to become biased against certain groups. Many definitions have been proposed in the literature, but the fundamental task of reasoning about probabilistic events is a challenging one, owing to the intractability of inference. The focus of this paper is taking steps towards the application of tractable probabilistic models to fairness in machine learning. Tractable probabilistic models have recently emerged that guarantee that conditional marginal can be computed in time linear in the size of the model. In particular, we show that sum product networks (SPNs) enable an effective technique for determining the statistical relationships between protected attributes and other training variables. We will also motivate the concept of “fairness through percentile equivalence”, a new definition predicated on the notion that individuals at the same percentile of their respective distributions should be treated equivalently, and this prevents unfair penalisation of those individuals who lie at the extremities of their respective distributions. We compare the efficacy of this pre-processing technique with an alternative approach that assumes an additive contribution. It was found that when these two approaches were compared on a data set containing the results of law school applicants, the percentile equivalence method reduced the average underestimation in the exam score of ethnic minority applicants black applicants at the bottom end of their conditional distribution by about a fifth.

Predictive models for this goal are built on the assumption that there is a dependency between the client’s profile before the loan approval and their future behavior. However, circumstances that cause changes in the client’s behavior may not depend on their will and cannot be predicted by their profile. Such clients may be considered “noisy” as their eventual belonging to the defaulters class results rather from random factors than from some predictable rules. Excluding such clients from the dataset may be helpful in building more accurate predictive models. In this paper, we report on primary results on testing the hypothesis that a client can become a defaulter in two scenarios: intentionally and unintentionally. We verify our hypothesis applying data driven regularized classification using an autoencoder to client profiles. To model an intention as a hidden variable, we propose an especially designed regularizer for the autoencoder. The regularizer aims to obtain a representation of defaulters that includes a cluster of intentional defaulters and unintentional defaulters as outliers.

A credit score is a numerical quantity that can be qualified by a rating label showing the potential risk. In order to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue at the exact interest rate and credit limits, the lenders take into accounts these credit scores. In this context, the robust statistical models are inevitable to reduce the number of wrong decisions in the credit evaluation process. Although the machine learning approaches provide superior performance to conventional statistical methods, they are mostly criticized due to the selection of model structure, model complexity, tuning parameters, time consumption in the high-dimensional and excessive nonlinear cases. For this reason, this study introduces an efficient model estimation and feature selection procedure for artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers in the context of credit scoring. Essentially, this procedure hybridizes training of ANNs with a novel feature selection approach based on genetic algorithms and information complexity criterion. In the application, the proposed procedure was performed on a couple of benchmark credit scoring datasets. According to analysis results, the proposed approach not only estimates robust models from ANNs in terms of model complexity, feature selection, and time consumption, but also outperforms the traditional training procedure for the classification accuracies, false positive, and false negative errors overtraining and test datasets.",artificial neural networks | credit scoring | feature selection | genetic algorithms | ICOMP | information complexity,5,0,,,,2018‐31,

Over the last decade, the emerging of social lending platforms has disrupted traditional services for credit risk assessment. Through these platforms, lenders and borrowers can easily interact among them without any involvement of financial institutes. In particular, they support borrowers in the fundraising process, enabling the participation of any number and size of lenders. However, the lack of lenders’ experience and missing or uncertain information about borrower's credit history can increase risks in social lending platforms, requiring an accurate credit risk scoring. To overcome such issues, the credit risk assessment problem of financial operations is usually modeled as a binary problem on the basis of debt's repayment and proper machine learning techniques can be consequently exploited. In this paper, we propose a benchmarking study of some of the most used credit risk scoring models to predict if a loan will be repaid in a P2P platform.

The proposed approach provides direct and automatic balancing of covariate distributions. In addition, the AUC-based approach is able to detect subtler distributional differences than existing measures, such as simple empirical mean/variance and count-based metrics. Thus, optimizing AUCs achieves a greater balance than the existing methods.

We minimize covariate imbalance by minimizing the absolute value of the distance of the maximum cross-validated AUC on M folds from 0.50, using evolutionary optimization. We demonstrate that particle swarm optimization (PSO) outperforms modified cuckoo swarm (MCS) for a gradient-free, non-linear noisy cost function. To compute AUCs, we use supervised binary classification approaches from the machine learning and credit scoring literature.

In this research, we show that it is possible to steer data representations in the latent space of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using a semi-supervised learning framework and a specific grouping of the input data called Weight of Evidence (WoE). Our proposed method learns a latent representation of the data showing a well-defied clustering structure. The clustering structure captures the customers’ creditworthiness, which is unknown a priori and cannot be identified in the input space. The main advantages of our proposed method are that it captures the natural clustering of the data, suggests the number of clusters, captures the spatial coherence of customers’ creditworthiness, generates data representations of unseen customers and assign them to one of the existing clusters. Our empirical results, based on real data sets reflecting different market and economic conditions, show that none of the well-known data representation models in the benchmark analysis are able to obtain well-defined clustering structures like our proposed method.

But one of the major problem banking sectors face in this ever-changing economy is the increasing rate of loan defaults, and the banking authorities are finding it more difficult to correctly assess loan requests and tackle the risks of people defaulting on loans. The two most critical questions in the banking industry are (i) How risky is the borrower? and (ii) Given the borrower's risk, should we lend him/her? In light of the given problems, this paper proposes two machine learning models to predict whether an individual should be given a loan by assessing certain attributes and therefore help the banking authorities by easing their process of selecting suitable people from a given list of candidates who applied for a loan. This paper does a comprehensive and comparative analysis between two algorithms (i) Random Forest, and (ii) Decision Trees. Both the algorithms have been used on the same dataset and the conclusions have been made with results showing that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the Decision Tree algorithm with much higher accuracy.",Credit Risk | Credit Score | Data Analysis | Decision Trees | Loan Prediction | Machine Learning | Random Forest,18,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

However, there is a growing trend of integrating survival analysis into credit scoring to provide a dynamic prediction on PD over time and a clear explanation on censoring. A novel dynamic credit scoring model (i.e., SurvXGBoost) is proposed based on survival gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach. Our proposal, which combines survival analysis and GBDT approach, is expected to enhance predictability relative to statistical survival models. The proposed method is compared with several common benchmark models on a real-world consumer loan dataset. The results of out-of-sample and out-of-time validation indicate that SurvXGBoost outperform the benchmarks in terms of predictability and misclassification cost. The incorporation of macroeconomic variables can further enhance performance of survival models.

Such technological developments from artificial intelligence (AI) labs have ushered concomitant applications across the world of business, where an “AI” brand-tag is quickly becoming ubiquitous. A corollary of such widespread commercial deployment is that when AI gets things wrong—an autonomous vehicle crashes, a chatbot exhibits “racist” behavior, automated credit-scoring processes “discriminate” on gender, etc.—there are often significant financial, legal, and brand consequences, and the incident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for such mistakes is that “.. all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting.” The key, as Pearl suggests, is to replace “reasoning by association” with “causal reasoning” —the ability to infer causes from observed phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis in a recent piece for the New York Times: “we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets—often using an approach known as ‘Deep Learning’—and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space, and causality.” In this paper, foregrounding what in 1949 Gilbert Ryle termed “a category mistake”, I will offer an alternative explanation for AI errors; it is not so much that AI machinery cannot “grasp” causality, but that AI machinery (qua computation) cannot understand anything at all.",artificial intelligence | artificial neural networks | causal cognition | Chinese room argument | cognitive science | dancing with pixies | Penrose-Lucas argument,17,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The corporate loan from financial institution increases financial www.earticle.net institution's credit exposure. Because measurement of the impact on the credit risk in the financial institution is used in determining the pricing model and structure of loan products, it is an essential factor for the financial institution that affects its profit structure. In terms of risk management, predicting delinquency using loan data is necessary for 5,000 Korean financial institutions. In several studies, bankruptcy forecasting was conducted on listed companies that disclosed financial and stock price information. However, this study increases the practical utility by extending the analysis target to individual entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs). In addition, this study presents representative big data analysis results by utilizing loan, delinquency, and technology credit information of approximately 1.1 million corporations, which is 20% of almost 5.6 million domestic sole proprietors and non-listed corporations. For loan data, it includes ten monthly loan type codes and eleven overdue reason codes. Prediction targets are separated by individual and corporate entrepreneurs. Also, analyses are divided by use of the processed dataset. For efficient analysis, the data dimension was reduced by changing the table structure through nested iterative operations while expanding the variable composition from a table consisting of N rows to one column. To reflect the characteristics of the data as much as possible, exploratory data analysis and feature-engineering were performed to process the data. Also, classification models are classified by four groups using a parametric method that nine models train for classification. Group 1 consists of Logistic Regression and Linear discriminant analysis based on the parametric method, group 2 consists of several algorithms that calculate the distance for model learning. In addition, group 3 consists of tree-based algorithms, which are also non-parametric methods. Group 4 consists of the semi-parametric method, which is deep neural network. However, out of the total 438,697 corporations, 810 defaulted, accounting for only 0.2% of the forecast, so the target distribution is severely imbalanced. For this reason, before model fitting, under sampling of imbalanced data was performed. The bias of the sampled training and validation data is minimized by performing. K-fold cross validation as much as the level of K=5. Finally, the analysis result suggests a significant effect on classification performance when the processed data is used. However, this study suggests no significant effect on performance when loan owner's characteristics are included. Moreover, tech-credit rating (TCB) information gives any meaningful effect regarding the type of corporation. Also, classification with Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is based on the Semi-parametric method, makes the best performance of binary classification. Non-parametric and Non-tree based models are not appropriate methods for analyzing loan data. In the case of the DNN based on the semi-parametric methodology, the highest classification performance was confirmed for all analyses and entrepreneurs' classifications performed in this study. The neural network used in this study consists of 14 hidden layers. According to the neural network baseline design, the sigmoid function was applied to the activation function's initial value, the relu function was applied to the hidden layer, and optimization was performed through the Adam optimizer. In particular, the analysis of credit transaction information based on credit information of all financial institutions in www.earticle.net Korea was conducted, and there is a possibility for alleviating information asymmetry of individual credit institutions regarding risk management targets. In addition, in the case of parametric methodologies used in classical studies and most used in practice, the average classification performance for major segments was inferior to that of semi-parametric methodologies. Furthermore, the difference between these performances is up to 16 percent. This paper suggests the direction of using loan-sample data. It is foundational research for financial institutions that are using loan data for credit risk management. It is necessary to expand research focusing on semi-parametric methodologies about corporate credit information analysis.",Corporate Loan Data | Distress Risk | Machine Learning | Predicting Loan Delinquency | Sample DB Remote Analysis System,0,0,,,,undefined,

In this paper we generalize the strategic classification model to such scenarios. We define the “price of opacity” as the difference in prediction error between opaque and transparent strategy-robust classifiers, characterize it, and give a sufficient condition for this price to be strictly positive, in which case transparency is the recommended policy.

This can be expected to have the effect of improving accuracy and the effect of improving the interpretability of the model. We were able to reduce it from 46 variables to 22 variables.

Such AI scoring has the potential to extend credit to those whose creditworthiness is not captured by standard scores. At the same time, it presents new concerns that current regulatory schemes are ill-equipped to address. This paper raises these concerns and compares the current U.S. and EU regulatory regimes insofar as they may apply to the emerging AI scoring industry. The first issue is data privacy in AI credit scoring. The EU regulates this under the omnibus approach of the General Data Protection Regulation, in the United States it implicates the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The second issue is discrimination in AI-based lending, which falls under the U.S. Equal Credit Opportunity Act and a number of European Anti-Discrimination Directives. The paper discusses the discrimination issue in the context of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s decision to grant the noaction letter requested by FinTech lender Upstart. In a postscript, we discuss the EU’s recent proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act and provide some preliminary thoughts on the Proposal’s provisions in the context of the challenges of AI scoring regulation raised in this paper.",,1,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

These decisions are made by applying a decision rule to individual's observed features. Given the impacts of these decisions on individuals, decision makers are increasingly required to be transparent on their decision making to offer the “right to explanation.” Meanwhile, being transparent also invites potential manipulations, also known as gaming, that individuals can utilize the knowledge to strategically alter their features in order to receive a more beneficial decision. In this work, we study the problem of robust decision-making under strategic behavior. Prior works often assume that the decision maker has full knowledge of individuals' cost structure for manipulations. We study the robust variant that relaxes this assumption: The decision maker does not have full knowledge but knows only a subset of the individuals' available actions and associated costs. To approach this non-quantifiable uncertainty, we define robustness based on the worst-case guarantee of a decision, over all possible actions (including actions unknown to the decision maker) individuals might take. A decision rule is called robust optimal if its worst case performance is (weakly) better than that of all other decision rules. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a crisp characterization of the above robust optimality: For any decision rules under mild conditions that are robust optimal, there exists a linear decision rule that is equally robust optimal. Second, we explore the computational problem of searching for the robust optimal decision rule and demonstrate its connection to distributionally robust optimization. We believe our results promote the use of simple linear decisions with uncertain individual manipulations.",,1,0,,,NSF,IIS-1939677,National Science Foundation

Since most P2P lending does not require any guarantees, the overdue payment of borrowers results in a massive loss of lending platforms and lenders. Many risk prediction models are proposed to predict credit risk. However, these works build models with more than 50 features, which causes a lot of computation time. Besides, in most P2P lending datasets, the number of non-default data far exceeds the number of default data. These researches ignore the data imbalance issue, leading to inaccurate predictions. Therefore, this study proposes a credit risk prediction system (CRPS) for P2P lending to solve data imbalance issues and only require few features to build the models. We implement a data preprocessing module, a feature selection module, a data synthesis module, and five risk prediction models in CRPS. In experiments, we evaluate CRPS based on the de-identified personal loan dataset of the LendingClub platform. The accuracy of the CRPS can achieve 99%, the recall reaches 0.95, and the F1-Score is 0.97.

Calculating credit scores can be a complicated process for people with thin credit histories or non-existent credit histories. Banks may refuse to give loans if the scores don't satisfy their requirements. Lack of a credit score is considered as an indicator for potential default and hence banks avoid sanctioning loans for people who come under this category. However, banks still offer loans if people are willing to offer securities. Credit Scoring can be done by using state-of-The-Art Machine Learning models.

This report aims to solve the problem about identification of default risk in bank before the credit extension or other service. The main solutions for this problem at present are setting black and white list, fixed threshold filtering. However, these two solutions have a lot of drawbacks: 1. They cannot be used to deal with a large number of loan transactions. 2. They take a lot time to complete estimation, which is not efficient. 3. The accuracy of these methods is low.

Due to the serious consequence of borrowers' breach of contract, banks need a valid method to help managing credit risk. Till now, the most common way is to set up blacklist and whitelist according to previous loan records to assist bank in deciding whether to offer loan to someone or not. In other words, there is a fixed threshold to filter customers. Once borrower has a number of violations beyond the threshold, the bank will add him into the blacklist which means the man cannot get debt in the future according to his poor credit. This simple method may be useful but it also has some inevitable downsides resulting from its empirical nature. For instance, this approach still needs to be conducted with countless bank workers, accounting for its failure in satisfying soaring need in current changeable loan scenario. Meanwhile, the manually set threshold is not sensitive to massive data, which is more than unavoidable in today's life. To the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods are suitable to deal with huge amount of data and make accurate predictions. Considering the characteristics in consumer lending and trust loan, we put forward a new algorithm model implemented with machine learning knowledge to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. The method contains some cutting-edge machine learning ideas such as tree model and neural network. This new credit scoring framework can solve above problems effectively and control the expenditure within an acceptable range. In the experiments, we evaluate our method extensively on bank credit dataset, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms most credit scoring and risk prediction methods, achieving an AUC of 0.840 on the Test Set.",algorithm model | credit risk management | financial technology | machine learning | risk prediction,0,0,,,,undefined,

As a result, in assessing the solvency of potential microloan borrowers, the subjective opinion of the expert and the incompetent or deliberate interpretation of the information resulting in the adoption of decisions that are detrimental to the microfinance organization are overweight. To increase the degree of objectivity, the paper discusses an approach to assessing the responsibility and solvency of microloan borrowers, based on the use of the fuzzy maxmin convolution method of multi-criteria choice of alternatives under uncertainty. Taking into account the weakly structured personal data of applicants this approach allows them to be flexibly and promptly assessed for microcredits. The applied qualitative criteria of assessment are weighed on the base of agreed expert opinions relative to priority of each of them. An important advantage of the applied model is that it is simple, convenient to use and able to adapt to the requirements of various commercial banks and micro-financial organizations.

Credit risk evaluation of the borrowers in an effective way is a crucial task, especially in social lending, where chances of being defaulted are more than the traditional models. Social lending datasets are imbalanced in nature due to the low number of defaulters than successful borrowers. Machine learning models based on such datasets contain biasing towards the class representing the majority of samples (majority class). Therefore, the probability of accurate prediction of minority class samples is decreased due to biasing towards majority class samples. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering-based hybrid sampling (CBHS) algorithm, where multi-phase K-means clustering is applied on the minority class samples to perform oversampling (KMBOS), and fuzzy C-means clustering is used on the majority class samples to perform undersampling (FCBU).

However, acclaimed contemporary credit risk measures such as the scores provided by FICO or Vantage are not publicly accessible. This paper addresses the problem of developing an alternative credit scoring measure that approximates the behavior of the original FICO score in a large-scale collection of loan-related data available from Lending Club. The severity of the underlying problem is manifested by the limited amount of knowledge which can be obtained for both the exact analytical formula and the complete set of credit-specific features that underpin the computation of FICO score. The proposed measure will be derived by exploiting a limited amount of entry-level information submitted by each candidate borrower without requiring the accumulation of historical credit data for each consumer over large periods of time. We are particularly interested in expressing the acquired credit risk measure in a closed analytical form of adjustable complexity. For this purpose, we utilize a symbolic regression technique which operates within the framework of Genetic Programming (GP). In this context, we harness the notion of Occam's razor to apply evolutionary pressure towards the preservation of models associated with reduced complexity and higher degree of human interpretability. In order to verify the validity of our approach we compare the approximation ability of the GP-based symbolic regression against state-of-the-art machine learning-based regression methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs). Our experimentation demonstrates that GP-based symbolic regression achieves comparable accuracy with respect to the aforementioned benchmark techniques. At the same time, the acquired analytical model can provide valuable insights concerning the credit risk assessment mechanisms that underlie the computation of FICO based on a significantly reduced set of credit-related features.",Credit Risk Assessment | Genetic Programming | Neural Networks | Radial Basis Functions Networks | Support Vector Machines,0,0,,,,undefined,

Based on modern financial theory and new credit instruments, modern risk measurement models have played a great role in the measurement of credit risk. However, most of these models assume normal distribution, which will lead to a deviation between the analysis results and the actual distribution of credit risk, cause the “thick tail” phenomenon, and reduce the accuracy of measurement results. In this context, the development of modern information technology makes it possible to introduce artificial intelligence technology into credit risk measurement, such as an artificial neural network, decision tree, genetic program-ming, and support vector machine. Design/Methodology/Approach – Firstly, we use the commonly used an expert survey method and the research results and experience of previous scholars for reference to realize the transformation of regulatory indicators from qualitative to quantitative. Then, a credit risk measurement model based on the Hopfield network was constructed in order to evaluate credit risk. Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out using real data from a commercial bank. Findings – The results show that a credit risk measurement model based on Hopfield neural network can accurately reflect the credit risk state of banking institutions. This shows that the credit risk measurement model proposed in this paper not only has the function of supporting decision-making for commercial bank managers, it is also an effective way for financial regulators to grasp the risk change trend in time. Research Implications – A credit risk measurement model of commercial banks based on a discrete Hopfield neural network is proposed. Because an artificial neural network has the advantages of strong “robustness”, high prediction accuracy, and is unstructured, this paper uses the associative memory function of DHNN to construct a credit risk measurement model based on a discrete Hopfield neural network.

It is a common practice in credit strategy to employ two machine learning model scores for credit risk segmentation, with one internal risk score, usually developed using its own historical portfolio performance data, and one external score from a third-party source, such as the FICO Score. Each score is binned into several segments constrained by a set of business requirements. An input matrix is constructed using the binning of scores on the horizontal and vertical axis respectively. This paper proposes a mixed integer programming model that partitions the input matrix into rectangular shaped sub-matrices (i.e., segments) maximizing the divergence between high risk and low risk customers via Information Value. The model ensures that default rates of segments are monotonic both horizontally and vertically, and business requirements on segment size and upper/lower bounds on the number of loan defaults in each segment are met. The proposed solution also prescribes the optimal number of risk segments. Traditional segmentation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms cannot guarantee monotonicity and rectangular shape of the segments, resulting in manual adjustments, deteriorated performance of divergence and sub-optimal number of segments.

Therefore, it is important for financial service providers (FSPs) to differentiate between low- and high-quality SMEs to accurately forecast the credit risk. This study proposes a novel hybrid ensemble machine learning approach to forecast the credit risk associated with SMEs’ agriculture 4.0 investments in SCF. Two core approaches were used, i.e., Rotation Forest algorithm and Logit Boosting algorithm. Key variables influencing the credit risk of agriculture 4.0 investments in SMEs were identified and evaluated using data collected from 216 agricultural SMEs, 195 Leading Enterprises and 104 FSPs operating in African agriculture sector. Besides the classical measures of credit risk assessment without involving SCF, the findings indicate that current ratio, financial leverage, profit margin on sales and growth rate of the agricultural SME are the upmost important variables that SCF actors need to focus on, in order to accurately and optimistically forecast and alleviate credit risk. The output of our study provides useful guidelines for SMEs, as it highlights the conditions under which they would be seen as creditworthy by FSPs. On the other hand, this study encourages the wide application of SCF in financing agriculture 4.0 investments.

With the development of science and technology, big data technology has penetrated into the financial field, and personal credit investigation has entered a new era. Personal credit evaluation based on big data is one of the hot research topics. This paper mainly completes three works. Firstly, according to the application scenario of credit evaluation of personal credit data, the experimental dataset is cleaned, the discrete data is one-HOT coded, and the data are standardized. Due to the high dimension of personal credit data, the pdC-RF algorithm is adopted in this paper to optimize the correlation of data features and reduce the 145-dimensional data to 22-dimensional data. On this basis, WOE coding was carried out on the dataset, which was applied to random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression models, and the performance was compared. It is found that logistic regression is more suitable for the personal credit evaluation model based on Lending Club dataset. Finally, based on the logistic regression model with the best parameters, the user samples are graded and the final score card is output.",,5,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

To accomplish this, a target function is proposed: a multiple non-linear regressive model. The relevance of computational finance is discussed, pointing out that is an area that has developed significantly in the last decades with different applications, some of these are: rich portfolio optimization, index-tracking, credit risk, stock investment, among others. Specifically, the Index Tracking Problem (ITP) concerns the prediction of stock market prices, being this a complex problem of the kind NP-hard.

Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting, the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of such 'naive updating' when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen.

In this study, a novel multi-stage ensemble model with a hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to achieve accurate and stable credit prediction. To alleviate the adverse effects of imbalanced data in credit scoring models, the Instance Hardness Threshold method is extended using a majority voting strategy to deal with data imbalance. To eliminate redundant and irrelevant features in the dataset and select well-performing base classifiers, a new hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal feature subset and base classifier subset. To aggregate the predictive power of the base classifiers, a stacking approach is adopted to integrate the optimal base classifiers into the ensemble model. The proposed model is tested on three standard imbalanced credit scoring datasets, compared with similar state-of-the-art approaches, and evaluated using four well-known evaluation indicators.

We confirm that machine-learning models are more accurate overall.

This adds a layer of difficulty to the ones represented by the need of large databases and data-and computationally-intensive decision-making systems as used in domains such as credit scoring and hiring. A novel analysis of this study is directly relating ML/AI fairness criteria and computational complexity.

This two-way collaboration has many potential risks that need to be assessed. If the borrower repays the loan, then the lender would make a profit from the interest. However, if the borrower fails to repay the loan, then the lender loses money. Therefore, lenders face predicting the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan at any step of the credit process. Many financial institutes calculate FICO scores of a customer based on some factors such as the Payment History (35%), Amounts owed (30%), Length of credit history (15%), Credit mix (10%), and New credit (10% of the total point) of the customer, that score qualifies how risk customers are, how repayment ability of the customer. FICO score (Fair Isaac Corporation) is a traditional approach used broadly in finance fields to estimate risks and give a worthy credit amount to the customer. In this study, a new way is to use Artificial intelligence to predict the above problems. It bases on credit information and more personal information of the customers to predict its repayment ability. The data collected from VietCredit Finances used for training several Machine Learning models to determine if the borrower can repay its loan. Some linear, nonlinear models involved are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine.

However, given the high-performance overhead of HE, financial institutions —whose processing rate requirements are stringent— are more oriented towards TEE-based solutions.

It is not a straightforward relationship, particularly in sovereign credit assessment. Modelling such a relationship requires blending scenario analysis and stress testing, together with dynamic modelling of macroeconomic and credit variables. The novelty of the presented approach is its ability to cross-pollinate machine learning and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation as part of a process that overcomes the challenges faced by risk managers. The result is a probabilistic forward-looking view of credit risk scenarios that can guide action. Sovereign credit ratings are expert opinions based on relevant macroeconomic, financial and policy information. We introduce a predictive machine learning model of sovereign credit ratings that lends itself naturally to MC simulations and stress testing. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) allows considering many variables simultaneously in a nonlinear fashion as candidates for predicting sovereign ratings. The portfolio stress testing capability comes in by augmenting the set of variables used in the MC simulations to include external shock variables common to the sovereigns in the portfolio, for example, relevant global commodity prices. The resulting rating distribution can be used to calculate different relevant risk metrics, including credit-sensitive measures of risk-weighted assets.",Capital adequacy | Credit rating | LASSO | Machine learning | Monte Carlo simulation | Sovereign risk | Stress testing,2,0,,,,undefined,

The GDPR is designed to give users more control over their personal data, which motivates us to explore machine learning frameworks for data sharing that do not violate user privacy. To meet this goal, in this article, we propose a novel lossless privacy-preserving tree-boosting system known as SecureBoost in the setting of federated learning. SecureBoost first conducts entity alignment under a privacy-preserving protocol and then constructs boosting trees across multiple parties with a carefully designed encryption strategy. This federated learning system allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over multiple parties with common user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds to a vertically partitioned dataset. An advantage of SecureBoost is that it provides the same level of accuracy as the non -privacy-preserving approach while at the same time, reveals no information of each private data provider. We show that the SecureBoost framework is as accurate as other nonfederated gradient tree-boosting algorithms that require centralized data, and thus, it is highly scalable and practical for industrial applications such as credit risk analysis. To this end, we discuss information leakage during the protocol execution and propose ways to provably reduce it.",Decision Tree | Federated Learning | Privacy | Security,138,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The credit scoring model represented by machine learning methods such as deep learning performs well in terms of the accuracy of default discrimination, but the model itself also has many shortcomings such as many hyperparameters and large dependence on big data. There is still a lot of room to improve its interpretability and robustness. Methods: the deep forest or multi-Grained Cascade Forest (gcForest) is a decision tree depth model based on the random forest algorithm. Using multidimensional scanning and cascading processing, gcForest can effectively identify and process high-dimensional feature information. At the same time, gcForest has fewer hyperparameters and has strong robustness. So, this paper constructs a two-stage hybrid default discrimination model based on multiple feature selection methods and gcForest algorithm, and at the same time, it optimizes the parameters for the lowest type II error as the first principle, and the highest AUC and accuracy as the second and third principles. GcForest can not only reflect the advantages of traditional statistical models in terms of interpretability and robustness but also take into account the advantages of deep learning models in terms of accuracy. Results: the validity of the hybrid default discrimination model is verified by three real open credit data sets of Australian, Japanese, and German in the UCI database. Conclusion: the performance of the gcForest is better than the current popular single classifiers such as ANN, and the common ensemble classifiers such as LightGBM, and CNNs in type II error, AUC, and accuracy. Besides, in comparison with other similar research results, the robustness and effectiveness of this model are further verified.",Credit loan | Credit score | Deep forest | Default discrimination | Feature selection,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,G2019501105,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In view of these two problems, this paper uses the idea of transfer learning to build a transferable personal credit risk model based on Instance-based Transfer Learning (Instance-based TL). The model balances the weight of the samples in the source domain, and migrates the existing large dataset samples to the target domain of small samples, and finds out the commonness between them.

In recent years, research has shown that machine learning has satisfactory performance in credit scoring. Because of the advantages of feature combination and feature selection, decision trees can match credit data which have high dimension and a complex correlation. Decision trees tend to overfitting yet. eXtreme Gradient Boosting is an advanced gradient enhanced tree that overcomes its shortcomings by integrating tree models. The structure of the model is determined by hyperparameters, which is aimed at the time-consuming and laborious problem of manual tuning, and the optimization method is employed for tuning. As particle swarm optimization describes the particle state and its motion law as continuous real numbers, the hyperparameter applicable to eXtreme Gradient Boosting can find its optimal value in the continuous search space. However, classical particle swarm optimization tends to fall into local optima. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an eXtreme Gradient Boosting credit scoring model that is based on adaptive particle swarm optimization. The swarm split, which is based on the clustering idea and two kinds of learning strategies, is employed to guide the particles to improve the diversity of the subswarms, in order to prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. In the experiment, several traditional machine learning algorithms and popular ensemble learning classifiers, as well as four hyperparameter optimization methods (grid search, random search, treestructured Parzen estimator, and particle swarm optimization), are considered for comparison. Experiments were performed with four credit datasets and seven KEEL benchmark datasets over five popular evaluation measures: Accuracy, error rate (type I error and type II error), Brier score, and F1 score. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other models on average. Moreover, adaptive particle swarm optimization performs better than the other hyperparameter optimization strategies.",,26,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

The resulting model replicates the original decision behavior while displaying new features and characteristics. In this paper, we apply this approach to a use case in the context of credit scoring. We use a private residential mortgage default dataset. We show that differential replication through copying can be exploited to adapt a given solution to the changing demands of a constrained environment such as that of the financial market. In particular, we show how copying can be used to replicate the decision behavior not only of a model, but also of a full pipeline.

Over the years, statistical and classical machine learning models have been the most researched risk management tools in credit scoring literature, and recently the focus has turned to deep learning models. This transition is due to better performances that are shown by deep learning models in different domains. Despite deep learning models' superior performances, there is still a need for explaining how these models make their predictions. The non-transparency nature of deep learning models has created a bottleneck for their use in credit scoring. Explanations of decisions are important for lending institutions since it is a requirement for automated decisions that are generated by non-transparent models to be explained. The other issue in using deep learning models, specifically 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in credit scoring is the need to have the data in image format. We propose an explainable deep learning model for credit scoring which can harness the performance benefits offered by deep learning and yet comply with the legislation requirements for the automated decision-making processes. The proposed method converts tabular datasets into images and thus allowing the application of 2D CNNs in credit scoring. Each pixel of the image corresponds to a feature bin of the tabular dataset. The predictions from the 2D CNNs were explained using state-of-the-art explanation methods. Furthermore, explanations were evaluated using a sanity check methodology and also performances of the explanation methods were compared quantitatively.

This study also compares the performance of logistic regression, support vector machine, neural network, decision tree and the deep learning models on single-year data. Design/methodology/approach: The data used are the financial data of public listed companies that been classified as PN17 status (distress) and non-PN17 (not distress) in Malaysia. This study was conducted using machine learning library of Python programming language. Findings: The findings indicate that all deep learning models used for this study achieved 90% accuracy and above with long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) getting 93% accuracy. In addition, deep learning models consistently have good performance compared to the other models over single-year data. The results show LSTM and GRU getting 90% and recurrent neural network (RNN) 88% accuracy. The results also show that LSTM and GRU get better precision and recall compared to RNN. The findings of this study show that the deep learning approach will lead to better performance in financial distress prediction studies. To be added, time-series data should be highlighted in any financial distress prediction studies since it has a big impact on credit risk assessment. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation of this study is the hyperparameter tuning only applied for deep learning models. Secondly, the time-series data are only used for deep learning models since the other models optimally fit on single-year data. Practical implications: This study proposes recommendations that deep learning is a new approach that will lead to better performance in financial distress prediction studies. Besides that, time-series data should be highlighted in any financial distress prediction studies since the data have a big impact on the assessment of credit risk.

As such, several data mining and machine learning approaches have been developed for computation of credit scores over the last few decades. Moreover, the existing rule-based classification algorithms tend to generate a number of rules with a large number of conditions in the antecedent part. However, these algorithms fail to demonstrate high predictive accuracy while balancing coverage and simplicity. Thus, it becomes quite a challenging task for the researchers to generate an optimal rule set with high predictive accuracy. In this paper, we present an effective rule based classification technique for the prediction of credit risk using a novel Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) method. The novel BBO in the context of rule mining is named as locally and globally tuned biogeography based rule-miner (LGBBO-RuleMiner). This is applied for discovering optimal rule set with high predictive accuracy from the dataset containing both the categorical and continuous attributes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against a variety of rule-miners such as OneR (1R), PART, JRip, Decision Table, Conjunctive Rule, J48, and Random Tree, along with some meta-heuristic based rule mining techniques by considering two credit risk datasets obtained from University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository. It is found from the comparative study that the proposed rule miner in ten independent runs of ten-fold cross validation outperforms all of the aforesaid algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy, coverage, and simplicity.",BBO | classification | credit analysis | data mining | machine learning | rule mining,7,0,,,,undefined,

Machine learning has been widely applied to automate the development of effective credit scoring models over the years. Yet, studies show that the development of robust credit scoring models may take longer than a year, and thus, if the behavior of customers changes over time, the model will be outdated even before its deployment. In this paper, we made 3 anonymized real-world credit scoring datasets available alongside the results obtained. In each of these datasets, we verify whether the credit scoring task should be thought as an ephemeral scenario since many of the variables may drift over time, and thus, data stream mining techniques should be used since they were tailored for incremental learning and to detect and adapt to changes in the data distribution. Therefore, we compare both traditional batch machine learning algorithms with data stream algorithms in different validation schemes using both Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Population Stability Index metrics. Furthermore, we also provide insights on the importance of features according to their Information Value, Mean Decrease Impurity, and Mean Positional Gain metrics, such that the last depicts changes in the importance of features over time.

Traditional risk management tools often fail to account for the complexity of the interactions in a financial system, and rely on simplistic distributional assumptions. In recent years machine learning techniques have been increasingly used, incorporating tools such as text mining, sentiment analysis, and network models in the risk management processes of financial institutions and supervisors. Network theory applications in particular are increasingly popular, as they allow to better model the intertwined nature of financial systems. In this work we set up an analytical framework that allows to decompose the credit risk of banks and sovereign countries in the European Union according to systematic (system-wide and regional) components. Then, the non-systematic components of risk are studied using a network approach, and a simple stress-test framework is set up to identify the potential transmission channels of distress and risk spillovers. Results highlight a relevant component of credit risk that is not explained by common factors, but can still be a potential vehicle for the transmission of shocks. We also show that due to the properties of the network structure, the transmission of shocks applied to different institutions is quite diversified, both in terms of breadth and speed.

For this reason, predictive analytics be-came the barometer of financiers with a main in-terest to corporate bankruptcy prediction (CBP), or referred to as financial distress prediction. Predictive analytics techniques are subdivided into two groups: traditional statistical (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and machine learning (e.g. artificial neural networks, support vector machines and random forest). Trained by metaheuristic algorithm such as artificial bee colony (ABC), an ANN model called ABCNN is applied in CBP and this new hybrid model is the contribution of our article. Our model is compared with two other models in order to investigate its efficiency: the first model is multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and the second one is an ANN trained by the most common learning algorithm a back propagation (BPNN). The models mentioned above were applied at two different periods in order to evaluate their efficiency. The first period is one year before the bankruptcy, and the second one is three years before. Performance was evaluated in terms of several metrics: Accuracy, AUC-score, type I and type II errors. The experimental results indicate that ANN models, on average, are approximately 10% more accurate in relation to MDA in different periods. Our Model ABCNN led to 92% accuracy, whereas BPNN’s and MDA’s led to 91% and 81% accuracy, respectively in one year before the bankruptcy. However, when we apply in the period three years before the bankruptcy, we find that ABCNN’s result is 80.94% followed by BPNN with 81.05%, then MDA-with 67.22%. The right data preprocessing applied has increased significantly the predictive power of all the models mentioned above.

This precision remained robust for all the classes of the ratings, ranging from the highest credit quality to the default mode as well. Moreover, our findings also revealed that the Artificial Neural Networks are ranked second for the overall predictions that have been made. However, for the speculative and default grades, our findings suggest that the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are significantly relevant, and although their precision is less than the random forests, the difference is not significant. Therefore, we propose that, for the stressed banks, both random forests and the CART should be employed, for a better and more informed risk assessment.

In terms of ensemble selection, the proposed method can assign weights to base models dynamically according to the overfitting measure. Validated on five public datasets, the proposed approach is compared with several popular benchmark models and selection strategies on predictive accuracy and computational cost measures.

In other words, the generated examples are all false positives as they cannot occur in practice. To circumvent this limitation, we propose CoEvA2, a search-based method that generates valid adversarial examples (satisfying the domain constraints). CoEvA2 utilizes multi-objective search in order to simultaneously handle constraints, perform the attack and maximize the overdraft amount requested. We evaluate CoEvA2 on a major bank's real-world system by checking its ability to craft valid attacks. CoEvA2 generates thousands of valid adversarial examples, revealing a high risk for the banking system.

Dataset, comprising of 25 attributes and 30k instances, was obtained from the repository of machine learning, University of California, Irvine (UCI). Our results show that, of all the four models used, DSVM can best predict defaulters.

Moreover, ELM performance depends on activation function, weights and biases assigned to hidden neurons.

The present computational work focuses on building a credit scoring prediction model. A publicly available German credit data is incorporated in this study. An improvement in the credit scoring prediction has been shown with the use of different feature selection techniques (such as Information-gain, Gain-Ratio and Chi-Square) and machine learning classifiers (Bayesian, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree (C5.0) and SVM (support Vector Machine)). Further, a comparative analysis is performed between different machine learning classifiers and between different feature selection techniques. Different evaluation metrics are considered for analyzing performance of the models (such as accuracy, F-measure, false positive rate, false negative rate and training time).

In this study, a combination of random forest (RF) and Chi-Square (CS) is found good, among other combinations, with respect to good performance accuracy, F-measure and low false positive and false negative rates.

In the proposed learning paradigm, three stages are involved. In the first stage, four indexes are introduced to evaluate the noise level of attributes. In the second stage, attributes with different noise levels are divided into different attribute sets in accordance with the dual-voting results of noise level. In the third stage, credit datasets with different attributes sets are dealt with different learning strategies and different de-noising methods for comparison purpose. In the proposed learning paradigm, a classification and regression tree (CART) model is adopted as the generic classifier to evaluate the performance on training datasets generated by different learning strategies and noise reduction methods. In addition, the performance of all learning strategies on sparse data with attribute noise is also discussed. Experimental results show that the proposed learning paradigm performs better than the benchmarks to solve the attribute noise problem not only in accuracy and its stability, but also in speediness. Further analysis indicates that the sparse data with attribute noise can further improve the stability of accuracy for a specific de-noising method.

Therefore, credit scoring assessments using artificial intelligence has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Successful machine learning methods can provide rapid analysis of credit scores while updating older ones on a daily time scale. Related studies have shown that neural networks and support vector machines outperform other techniques by providing better prediction accuracy. The purpose of this paper is two fold. First, we provide a survey and a comparative analysis of results from literature applying machine learning techniques to predict credit rating. Second, we apply ourselves four machine learning techniques deemed useful from previous studies (Bagged Decision Trees, Random Forest, support vector machine and Multilayer Perceptron) to the same datasets. We evaluate the results using a 10-fold cross validation technique. The results of the experiment for the datasets chosen show superior performance for decision tree based models. In addition to the conventional accuracy measure of classifiers, we introduce a measure of accuracy based on notches called ”Notch Distance” to analyze the performance of the above classifiers in the specific context of credit rating. This measure tells us how far the predictions are from the true ratings. We further compare the performance of three major rating agencies, Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch where we show that the difference in their ratings is comparable with the decision tree prediction versus the actual rating on the test dataset.",Classification trees | Credit rating | Machine learning models | Neural networks | Support vector machine,30,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Experimental findings reveal that the performance of ensemble learning is better than individual learners, except for AdaBoost. In addition, random forest has the best performance in terms of five metrics, XGBoost and LightGBM are close challengers. Among five baseline classifiers, logistic regression outperforms the other classifiers over the most of evaluation metrics. Finally, this study also analyzes reasons for the poor performance of some algorithms and give some suggestions on the choice of credit scoring models for financial institutions.",Baseline classifiers | Comparative assessment | Credit scoring | Ensemble learning,51,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,2019JWZD39,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The quantitative tools used are statistical and machine learning models, similar to credit risk rating of loans. As dependent variables, the models use data found in electronic databases present in e-government implementations. A previously classified listing of suspended companies is used as a proxy for risky contracts, as it contains private companies which failed with their contractual obligations. The classification techniques utilized are logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, discriminant analysis, support vector machine and random forests. Although the methods can be applied to any government with electronic procurement and contracts systems, Brazilian data is used to illustrate the benefits of contract governance for emerging economies.

Furthermore, small improvements to credit scoring systems and default forecasting can support huge profits. Accordingly, banks and financial institutions have a high interest in any changes. The literature shows that the use of feature selection techniques can reduce the dimensionality problems in most credit risk datasets, and, thus, improve the performance of the credit risk model. Many other works also indicated that various classification approaches would also affect the performance of the credit risk assessment modelling. In this research, based on the new proposed framework, we investigated the effect of various filter-based feature selection techniques with various classification approaches, namely, single and ensemble classifiers, on three credit datasets (German, Australian, and Japanese credit risk datasets) with the aim of improving the performance of the credit risk model. All single and ensemble classifier-based models were evaluated using four of the most used performance metrics for assessing financial stress models. From the comparison analysis between, with, and without applying the feature selection and across the three credit datasets, the Random-Forest + Information-Gain model achieved a better trade-off in improving the model's accuracy rate with the value of 96% for the Australian credit dataset. This model also obtained the lowest Type I error with the value of 4% for the German credit dataset, the lowest Type II error with the value of 2% for the German credit dataset and the highest value of G-mean of 95% for the Australian credit dataset. The results clearly indicate that the Random-Forest + Information-Gain model is an excellent predictor for the credit risk cases.",Credit risk assessment | Credit scoring prediction | Ensemble classifiers | Feature selection techniques | Machine learning in credit risk assessment | Single classifiers,0,0,,,PNU,undefined,Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University

Many banking sectors are looking into an automated decision support system for credit risk evaluation. Consequently, many automated credit risk evaluation systems have been proposed, however most of them lack in explainability needed to justify their decisions. To remedy this, this paper proposes a decision support system named Transparent Decision Support System for Credit Risk Evaluation (TDSSCRE), which extracts concise and justifiable rules from neural networks for credit risk decision. The proposed TDSSCRE tunes and prunes the rules to assist in making a decision support system transparent. Finally this transparent decision support system with concise rules justifies the decision for why applications are granted/rejected with a significant predictive accuracy. The decision system is validated with 3 credit risk datasets using 10 fold cross validation. From the experimental results it is observed that the proposed decision system can produce accurate and justifiable rules for classification. The decision system is also compared against two existing rule extraction models.",Credit Risk | Decision System | Machine Learning | Neural Network | Rule Extraction,3,0,,,,undefined,

Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are the Artificial Intelligence techniques that have been attracting interest due to their flexibility to account for various data patterns. Both are black-box models which are sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Feature selection can be performed on SVM to enable explanation with the reduced features, whereas feature importance computed by RF can be used for model explanation. The benefits of accuracy and interpretation allow for significant improvement in the area of credit risk and credit scoring. This paper proposes the use of Harmony Search (HS), to form a hybrid HS-SVM to perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning simultaneously, and a hybrid HS-RF to tune the hyperparameters. A Modified HS (MHS) is also proposed with the main objective to achieve comparable results as the standard HS with a shorter computational time. MHS consists of four main modifications in the standard HS: (i) Elitism selection during memory consideration instead of random selection, (ii) dynamic exploration and exploitation operators in place of the original static operators, (iii) a self-adjusted bandwidth operator, and (iv) inclusion of additional termination criteria to reach faster convergence. Along with parallel computing, MHS effectively reduces the computational time of the proposed hybrid models. The proposed hybrid models are compared with standard statistical models across three different datasets commonly used in credit scoring studies. The computational results show that MHS-RF is most robust in terms of model performance, model explainability and computational time.",Artificial intelligence | Credit scoring | Feature selection | Harmony search | Hyperparameter tuning | Random forest | Support vector machines,10,1,repositoryam,Green,,GP-IPS/2018/9646000,Universiti Putra Malaysia

Thus, predicting and rating the default contagion chains in the guarantee network in order to reduce or prevent potential systemic financial risk, attracts a grave concern from the Regulatory Authority and the banks. Existing credit risk models in the banking industry utilize machine learning methods to generate a credit score for each customer. Such approaches dismiss the contagion risk from guarantee chains and need extensive feature engineering with deep domain expertise. To this end, we propose a novel approach to rate the risk of contagion chains in the bank industry with the deep neural network. We employed the temporal inter-chain attention network on graph-structured loan behavior data to compute risk scores for the contagion chains. We show that our approach is significantly better than the state-of-the-art baselines on the dataset from a major financial institution in Asia. Besides, we conducted empirical studies on the real-world loan dataset for risk assessment.

In sensor networks, in collaborative health or genomic projects, in credit risk analysis, among other domains, distinct features are collected from multiple sources, including the use of social media and mobile applications, and due to privacy concerns or communication costs, may not be shared among sites. This scenario of vertical data partitioning poses challenges to traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, as classical algorithms are designed to learn from the complete set of features. A common strategy is to combine predictions from local models trained at each site into a global model, and for this purpose, several aggregation methods have been proposed. In this work we tackle a gap within the related literature, performing a comparative evaluation of elementary and meta-learning-based aggregation methods to reveal their strengths and weakness for 46 datasets with varied characteristics. We show that no method outperforms its counterparts in all domains, emphasizing the need for experimental comparison to ensure a good choice in the domain of interest. Moreover, our experiments provide the first insights into the relations between datasets’ properties and aggregators’ performance. We show that for low class imbalance and a good instance-to-feature ratio, almost all aggregation methods tend to perform well. The silhouette coefficient (reflecting class separability) and class imbalance coefficient are the most influential properties on aggregators’ performance, thus we recommend their analysis in the first step of the methodological design. We found that arithmetic-based methods are not suitable for datasets with poor class separability and a large number of classes, whereas meta-learning approaches are less sensitive for datasets with silhouette coefficient close to 0. Our analyses were summarized as classification and regression trees, which have the impact to serve as practical tools for future research. Taken together, our findings give rise to interesting applications in the domain of intelligent systems, especially regarding their potential to reduce the burden of vast experimental comparisons when training ML models with feature-partitioned data.",Attribute-partitioned data | Classification | Distributed machine learning | Predictions aggregation | Vertical data partitioning,11,0,,,FAPERGS,17/2551-0000236-9,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul

The profitability of the banks thus highly depends on the models used to decide on the customer's loans. State-of-the-art credit scoring models are based on machine learning and statistical methods. One of the major problems of this field is that lenders often deal with imbalanced datasets that usually contain many paid loans but very few not paid ones (called defaults). Recently, dynamic selection methods combined with ensemble methods and preprocessing techniques have been evaluated to improve classification models in imbalanced datasets presenting advantages over the static machine learning methods. In a dynamic selection technique, samples in the neighborhood of each query sample are used to compute the local competence of each base classifier. Then, the technique selects only competent classifiers to predict the query sample. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of dynamic selection techniques for credit scoring problem, and we present Reduced Minority k-Nearest Neighbors (RMkNN), an approach that enhances state of the art in defining the local region of dynamic selection techniques for imbalanced credit scoring datasets. This proposed technique has a superior prediction performance in imbalanced credit scoring datasets compared to state of the art. Furthermore, RMkNN does not need any preprocessing or sampling method to generate the dynamic selection dataset (called DSEL). Additionally, we observe an equivalence between dynamic selection and static selection classification. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed technique against state-of-the-art competitors on six real-world public datasets and one private one.

To do so, we performed an extensive analysis to evaluate the predictive capabilities with up to 18 different ML techniques.

While qualitative data are usually relied on professional appraisers’ judgment, 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation could assist to organize appraisers’ scores to avoid any loss of information. In practice, a financial institute needs to regularly update its credit risk assessment model to maintain correct assessment results. However, every update involves a lot of numerical experiments using multiple systems or even software packages for evaluating the effect of different sampling methods and classifiers to construct a suitable model for the updated dataset. Such an assessment process is time-consuming with many repetitive processes.

Therefore, this paper proposes an expert system named Transparent Neural based Expert System for Credit Risk (TNESCR) evaluation which uses a white box neural model Rule Extraction from Neural Network using Classified and Misclassified data (RxNCM) to generate rules from financial data. The generated rules are so transparent to justify the explanations for why applications are granted/rejected with a significant predictive accuracy.

It is becoming evident that these technological developments are consequential to people’s fundamental human rights. Despite increasing attention to these urgent challenges in recent years, technical solutions to these complex socio-ethical problems are often developed without empirical study of societal context and the critical input of societal stakeholders who are impacted by the technology. On the other hand, calls for more ethically and socially aware AI often fail to provide answers for how to proceed beyond stressing the importance of transparency, explainability, and fairness. Bridging these socio-technical gaps and the deep divide between abstract value language and design requirements is essential to facilitate nuanced, context-dependent design choices that will support moral and social values.

Developing an effective classification rule induction (CRI) framework for bankruptcy prediction and credit risk analysis in appropriate time is essential to prevent the business communities from being bankrupt. Traditional statistical methods and artificial intelligence techniques play a major role to predict bankruptcy and credit risks. Most of the earlier research works were carried out on quantitative methods, while few studies have proposed on qualitative methods to improvise the performance of bankruptcy prediction models. The discovery of bankruptcy prediction in a qualitative way is an important task because it depends on the subjective knowledge of the experts.

Three different natured datasets are used to present a trustworthy result. For this experiment, we have collected qualitative_bankruptcy dataset and benchmarked by UCI repository.

The developed method is the first in the literature to apply the quadtree for the SVM parameters optimization. The SVM is a machine-learning technique for pattern recognition whose performance relies on its parameters determination. Thus, the model selection problem for SVM is an important field of study and requires expert and intelligent systems to solve it. Real classification data sets involve a huge number of instances and features, and the greater is the training data set dimension, the larger is the cost of a recognition system. The grid search (GS) is the most popular and the simplest method to select parameters for SVM. However, it is time-consuming, which limits its application for big-sized problems. With this in mind, the main idea of this research is to apply the quadtree technique to the GS to make it faster. Hence, this may lower computational time cost for solving problems such as bio-identification, bank credit risk and cancer detection. Based on the asymptotic behaviors of the SVM, it was noticeably observed that the quadtree is able to avoid the GS full search space evaluation. As a consequence, the GQ carries out fewer parameters analysis, solving the same problem with much more efficiency. To assess the GQ performance, ten classification benchmark data set were used.

This paper documents the automation of the back-end in the current wave of digitization. In particular, it highlights the use of technology in streamlining risk management and its potential to provide competitive advantage to the FIs embracing digitization. For instance, automated “big data” credit scoring tools built on predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms are employed to examine several credit propositions. This can accurately construct the credit worthiness and risk profile of public, even without any credit history. These developments can widen the access of credit and other financial services to the society. However, on a cautionary note, this study emphasizes that although digitization of back-end financial transactions carries substantive advantages, the FIs must be guarded against cyber, outsourcing, financial exclusion, and macrofinance risks that can manifest with this automation. In this backdrop, the need for robust yet agile regulations and supervisory counsel to control and exploit the digitization towards optimal benefits for banks and FIs and society at large, acquires salience. Furthermore, regulators and supervisory authorities can mitigate the digitization risks and prevent any public fallout by leveraging the use of digitization itself.",,11,0,,,ABS,undefined,American Bureau of Shipping

A novel spike-generating function is proposed in Leaky Nonlinear Integrate and Fire Model (LNIF). Its interspike period is computed and utilized in the extreme learning machine (ELM) for credit score classification. The proposed model is named as SELM and is validated on five real-world credit scoring datasets namely: Australian, German-categorical, German-numerical, Japanese, and Bankruptcy. Further, results obtained by SELM are compared with back propagation, probabilistic neural network, ELM, voting-based Q-generalized extreme learning machine, Radial basis neural network and ELM with some existing spiking neuron models in terms of classification accuracy, Area under curve (AUC), H-measure and computational time. From the experimental results, it has been noticed that improvement in accuracy and execution time for the proposed SELM is highly statistically important for all aforementioned credit scoring datasets. Thus, integrating a biological spiking function with ELM makes it more efficient for categorization.",credit score classification | extreme learning machine | spiking neuron model,23,0,,,,undefined,

Since the applicants on P2P lending platforms may lack sufficient financial history for assessment, quite a few P2P lending service providers have been utilizing the applicants' social relationships to improve the risk prediction accuracy of loan applications. However, utilizing the information of applicants' social relationships may introduce discrimination in prediction. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate the impact of the applicants' social relationships on the fairness of risk prediction for P2P lending. We investigate over a million loan records collected from Prosper.com, one of the leading P2P lending companies in the world. We construct the Prosper social network of loan borrowers and lenders, and generate the social features of applicants by adapting a state-of-the-art social credit scoring scheme to the Prosper social network. We consider two types of fairness notions in the literature, namely individual fairness and counterfactual fairness. Our results demonstrate that the social score harms both individual and counterfactual fairness of classification. To address this issue, we design two new algorithms that mitigate bias by generalizing social features.

From the perspective of lenders, they want to maximize the profit while minimizing the risk. Therefore, many studies have used machine learning algorithms to help the lenders identify the ""best"" loans for making investments. The studies have mainly focused on two categories to guide the lenders' investments: one aims at minimizing the risk of investment (i.e., the credit scoring perspective) while the other aims at maximizing the profit (i.e., the profit scoring perspective). However, they have all focused on one category only and there is seldom research trying to integrate the two categories together. Motivated by this, we propose a two-stage framework that incorporates the credit information into a profit scoring modeling. We conducted the empirical experiment on a real-world P2P lending data from the US P2P market and used the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM) algorithm in the two-stage framework. Results show that the proposed two-stage method could identify more profitable loans and thereby provide better investment guidance to the investors compared to the existing one-stage profit scoring alone approach.

It provides appropriate guidance on granting loans and reduces risks in the financial area. Hence, companies and banks are trying to use novel automated solutions to deal with CS challenge to protect their own finances and customers. Nowadays, different machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) algorithms have been used to improve various aspects of CS prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, named Deep Genetic Hierarchical Network of Learners (DGHNL). The proposed methodology comprises different types of learners, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), and fuzzy systems. The Statlog German (1000 instances) credit approval dataset available in the UCI machine learning repository is used to test the effectiveness of our model in the CS domain. Our DGHNL model encompasses five kinds of learners, two kinds of data normalization procedures, two extraction of features methods, three kinds of kernel functions, and three kinds of parameter optimizations. Furthermore, the model applies deep learning, ensemble learning, supervised training, layered learning, genetic selection of features (attributes), genetic optimization of learners parameters, and novel genetic layered training (selection of learners) approaches used along with the cross-validation (CV) training-testing method (stratified 10-fold). The novelty of our approach relies on a proper flow and fusion of information (DGHNL structure and its optimization). We show that the proposed DGHNL model with a 29-layer structure is capable to achieve the prediction accuracy of 94.60% (54 errors per 1000 classifications) for the Statlog German credit approval data.

Using a proprietary data set of 1,184 defaulted corporate leases in Germany, this study explores different parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric approaches that attempt to predict the LGD. By conducting the analyses for different information sets, we study how the prediction accuracy changes depending on the set of information that is available. Furthermore, we use a variable importance measure to identify the input variables that have the greatest effects on the LGD prediction accuracy for each method. In this regard, we provide new insights on the characteristics of leasing LGDs. We find that (1) more sophisticated methods, especially the random forest, lead to remarkable increases in the prediction accuracy; (2) updating information improves the prediction accuracy considerably; and (3) the outstanding exposure at default, an internal rating, asset types and lessor industries turn out to be important drivers of accurate LGD predictions.",Forecasting | Leasing | Loss given default | Machine learning | Variable selection methods,15,0,,,,undefined,

Recent research has proposed several systems for improving credit rating. In this paper, a new scalable credit scoring multi-agent system called ""CSMAS"" is introduced for the prediction of problems in data mining of credit scoring domain. This engine is built using a seven-layer multi-agent system architecture to generate a data mining process based on the coordination of intelligent agents. CSMAS performance is based on preprocessing and data forecasting. The first layer is designed to retrieve any data from various core banking systems, payment systems, credit Bureaus and external databases and data sources and to store it in big data platform. The second layer is devoted to three different subtasks; feature engineering, pre-processing data and integrating diverse datasets. While the third layer is dedicated to dealing with missing Values and treating outliers. In the fourth layer, the techniques of dimensionality reduction are used to reduce the number of features in the original set of features. The fifth layer is dedicated to build a model using the new generation of Gradient Boosting Algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost) and make predictions. The sixth layer is designed for the model's evaluation. The seventh layer is made to perform the rating of new credit applicants. The performance of CSMAS is assessed using a large dataset of Home Credit Default Risk from Kaggle Challenge (307511 records) to evaluate the risk of a loan applicant as a major problem for banks. The results show that the CSMAS give relevant results. Therefore, the results indicated that the CSMAS can be further employed as a reliable tool to predict more complicated case in credit scoring.",Big Data | CatBoost | Credit Scoring | LightGBM | Multi-Agent System | XgBoost,5,0,,,,undefined,

This development has led to growing demand for ethical AI, often perceived to require human control over automation. By engaging in discussions of human-computer interaction and in post-structural policy analysis, I examine EU policy proposals to address the problematizations of AI through human oversight. I argue that the relevant policy documents do not reflect the results of earlier research which have undeniably demonstrated the shortcomings of human control over automation, which in turn leads to the reproduction of the harmful dichotomy of human versus machine in EU policy. Despite its shortcomings, the emphasis on human oversight reflects broader fears surrounding loss of control, framed as ethical concerns around digital technologies.

Class imbalance may affect the accuracy of default predictions, as classifiers tend to be biased towards the majority class (good borrowers). We analyse the default prediction performance when combining class rebalancing methods with different regression and machine learning techniques.

This study introduces SSL, cost-sensitive learning, a group method of data handling (GMDH), and an ensemble learning technique to propose a GMDH-based cost-sensitive semi-supervised selective ensemble (GCSSE) model. This involves two stages: (1)First, train an ensemble model composed of N base classifiers on the initial training set L with class labels, use it to selectively label the samples from the dataset U without class labels, add them with their predicted labels to the training set, and update the N base classifiers on the new training set; (2)Second, classify L and the test set using the respective trained base classifiers, and construct a cost-sensitive GMDH neural network to obtain the selective ensemble classification results for the test set.

Furthermore, the paper reflects the importance of using machine learning techniques in the financial field.

Although achieving great success in supervised classification, support vector machine (SVM) is much less utilized to classify unlabeled data points, which also induces many drawbacks including sensitive to nonlinear kernels and random initializations, high computational cost, unsuitable for imbalanced datasets. In this paper, to utilize the advantages of SVM and overcome the drawbacks of SVM-based clustering methods, we propose a completely new two-stage unsupervised classification method with no initialization: a new unsupervised kernel-free quadratic surface SVM (QSSVM) model is proposed to avoid selecting kernels and related kernel parameters, then a golden-section algorithm is designed to generate the appropriate classifier for balanced and imbalanced data. By studying certain properties of proposed model, a convergent decomposition algorithm is developed to implement this non-covex QSSVM model effectively and efficiently (in terms of computational cost). Numerical tests on artificial and public benchmark data indicate that the proposed unsupervised QSSVM method outperforms well-known clustering methods (including SVM-based and other state-of-the-art methods), particularly in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, we extend and apply the proposed method to credit risk assessment by incorporating the T-test based feature weights. The promising numerical results on benchmark personal credit data and real-world corporate credit data strongly demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and interpretability of proposed method, as well as indicate its significant potential in certain real-world applications.",Credit risk assessment | Data mining | Decomposition algorithm | Kernel-free quadratic surface SVM | Unsupervised classification,51,0,,,NSFC,71701035,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and surface are useful tools to assess the ability of diagnostic tests to discriminate between ordered classes or groups. To define these diagnostic tests, selecting the optimal thresholds that maximize the accuracy of these tests is required. One procedure that is commonly used to find the optimal thresholds is by maximizing what is known as Youden’s index. This article presents nonparametric predictive inference (NPI) for selecting the optimal thresholds of a diagnostic test. NPI is a frequentist statistical method that is explicitly aimed at using few modeling assumptions, enabled through the use of lower and upper probabilities to quantify uncertainty. Based on multiple future observations, the NPI approach is presented for selecting the optimal thresholds for two-group and three-group scenarios. In addition, a pairwise approach has also been presented for the three-group scenario. The article ends with an example to illustrate the proposed methods and a simulation study of the predictive performance of the proposed methods along with some classical methods such as Youden index.

Different data classification models were developed to foresee the financial crisis of an organization using their historical data. One important step towards the development of accurate financial crisis prediction (FCP) model involves the selection of appropriate variables (features) which are relevant for the problems at hand. This is termed as feature selection problem which helps to improve the classification performance. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based financial crisis prediction (FCP) model which incorporates two phases: ACO based feature selection (ACO-FS) algorithm and ACO based data classification (ACO-DC) algorithm. The proposed ACO-FCP model is validated using a set of five benchmark dataset includes both qualitative and quantitative. For feature selection design, the developed ACO-FS method is compared with three existing feature selection algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. In addition, a comparison of classification results is also made between ACO-DC and state of art methods. Experimental analysis shows that the ACO-FCP ensemble model is superior and more robust than its counterparts. In consequence, this study strongly recommends that the proposed ACO-FCP model is highly competitive than traditional and other artificial intelligence techniques.",Bankruptcy prediction | Credit risk | Feature selection | Machine learning | Metaheuristic,107,0,,,,undefined,

(2020) by allowing the decision maker to test a sequence of decision rules and observe agents' responses, in effect performing causal interventions through the decision rules.",,17,0,,,NSF,1813049,National Science Foundation

Using these models in P2P Lending have limitations. First, the credit data of P2P usually contains dense numerical features and sparse categorical features. Second, the existing credit scoring models are generally cannot be updated online. The loan transaction of P2P lending is very frequent and the new data leads data distribution to change. A credit scoring model without considering data update causes a serious deviation or even failure in subsequent credit assessment. In this paper, we propose a new online integrated credit scoring model (OICSM) for P2P Lending. OICSM integrates gradient boosting decision tree and neural network to make the credit scoring model can handle two types of features more effectively and update online. Offline and online experiments based on real and representative credit datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that OICSM can significantly improve performance due to its advantage in deep learning over two features, and it can further correct model deterioration due to its online dynamic update capability.",Credit scoring model | Deep learning | Machine learning | Online P2P lending | Online update,15,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,16ZDB52,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In this way, one of the biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. Recent studies mostly focus on enhancing the classifier performance for credit card default prediction rather than an interpretable model. In classification problems, an imbalanced dataset is also crucial to improve the performance of the model because most of the cases lied in one class, and only a few examples are in other categories. Traditional statistical approaches are not suitable to deal with imbalanced data. In this study, a model is developed for credit default prediction by employing various credit-related datasets. There is often a significant difference between the minimum and maximum values in different features, so Min-Max normalization is used to scale the features within one range. Data level resampling techniques are employed to overcome the problem of the data imbalance. Various undersampling and oversampling methods are used to resolve the issue of class imbalance. Different machine learning models are also employed to obtain efficient results. We developed the hypothesis of whether developed models using different machine learning techniques are significantly the same or different and whether resampling techniques significantly improves the performance of the proposed models. One-way Analysis of Variance is a hypothesis-testing technique, used to test the significance of the results. The split method is utilized to validate the results in which data has split into training and test sets. The results on imbalanced datasets show the accuracy of 66.9% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 70.7% on South German clients credit dataset, and 65% on Belgium clients credit dataset. Conversely, the results using our proposed methods significantly improve the accuracy of 89% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 84.6% on South German clients credit dataset, and 87.1% on Belgium clients credit dataset. The results show that the performance of classifiers is better on the balanced dataset as compared to the imbalanced dataset. It is also observed that the performance of data oversampling techniques are better than undersampling techniques. Overall, the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method performs better than other traditional machine learning classifiers. The Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method gives the best results while utilizing the K-means SMOTE oversampling method. Using one-way ANOVA, the null hypothesis was rejected by a p-value <0.001, hence confirming that the proposed model improved performance is statistical significance. The interpretable model is also deployed on the web to ease the different stakeholders. This model will help commercial banks, financial organizations, loan institutes, and other decision-makers to predict the loan defaulter earlier.",Credit card default model | Customer credit risk | Gradient boosted decision tree | Imbalanced data | Interpretable model | Machine learning,56,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NTNU,undefined,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet

To deploy such a machine learning model in production for loan application risk scoring it must comply with lending industry regulations that require lenders to provide understandable and specific reasons for credit decisions.

Notwithstanding, such an application of machine learning suffers with several limitations when put into practice, such as unbalanced datasets and, specially, the absence of sufficient information from the features that can be useful to discriminate reliable and unreliable loans. To overcome such drawbacks, we propose in this work a Two-Step Feature Space Transforming approach, which operates by evolving feature information in a twofold operation: (i) data enhancement; and (ii) data discretization. In the first step, additional meta-features are used in order to improve data discrimination. In the second step, the goal is to reduce the diversity of features. Experiments results performed in real-world datasets with different levels of unbalancing show that such a step can improve, in a consistent way, the performance of the best machine learning algorithm for such a task.

It marks the first attempt to leverage data on corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) to better predict credit risk in an ML context. Even though the literature on default and credit risk is vast, the potential explanatory power of CSI for firm credit risk prediction remains unexplored. Previous research has shown that CSI may jeopardize firm survival and thus potentially comes into play in predicting credit risk. We find that prediction accuracy varies considerably between algorithms, with advanced machine learning algorithms (e. g. random forests) outperforming traditional ones (e. g. linear regression). Random forest regression achieves an out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 89.75 % for adjusted R2 due to the ability of capturing non-linearity and complex interaction effects in the data. We further show that including information on CSI in firm credit risk prediction does not consistently increase prediction accuracy. One possible interpretation of this result is that CSI does not (yet) seem to be systematically reflected in credit ratings, despite prior literature indicating that CSI increases credit risk. Our study contributes to improving firm credit risk predictions using a machine learning design and to exploring how CSI is reflected in credit risk ratings.",Classification | Corporate Social Irresponsibility | Credit Risk | ESG | Machine Learning | Random Forests | Regression,1,0,,,,undefined,

Design/methodology/approach: This study used Chinese A-listed companies during 2007–2016. Board diversity dimensions of gender, age, education, expertise and independence are categorized into three broad categories; relation-oriented diversity (age and gender), task-oriented diversity (expertise and education) and structural diversity (independence). The data is divided into test and validation sets. Six statistical and machine learning models that included logistic regression, dynamic hazard, K-nearest neighbor, random forest (RF), bagging and boosting were compared on Type I errors, Type II errors, accuracy and area under the curve. Findings: The results indicate that board diversity attributes can significantly predict the financial distress of firms. Overall, the machine learning models perform better and the best model in terms of Type I error and accuracy is RF. Practical implications: This study not only highlights symptoms but also causes of financial distress, which are deeply rooted in weak corporate governance.

The results showed that machine learning techniques outperformed OLR in terms of predictive power. In the best specification model, random forest had an accuracy of 50%, followed by gradient boosting (47%) and OLR (25%). We also tested two types of sampling in the training and test sets: random and time-dependent. The results showed that the models’ predictive power was greater with random sampling. The inclusion of macroeconomic variables did not improve the models’ predictive power due to the rating agencies’ preferred through-the-cycle rating approach.

In recent years, many novel machine learning models have been developed for credit scoring. Among the existing machine learning models, the heterogeneous ensemble model receives much attention because of its superior performance. This paper presents a new heterogeneous ensemble model based on the generalized Shapley value and the Choquet integral. To do this, the model first uses the fuzzy measure to express the interactive characteristics between any two coalitions of base learners. Based on the accuracy and diversity objective function, a linear programming model for determining the fuzzy measure is built. To retain the original information as much as possible in the training stage, the normal fuzzy number is employed to express the base learner predicted values. Then, the generalized Shapley Choquet integral (GSCI) aggregation operator is defined to calculate the comprehensive predicted value of the ensemble model. Based on the defined aggregation operator and linear programming model, a GSCI approach is proposed for ensemble credit scoring. To illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the GSCI approach, an experiment of thirteen machine learning models over four public credit scoring datasets and three real-world P2P leading datasets with large volumes of samples is made. Furthermore, robust tests and comparatives analysis are made to demonstrate the adaptability and performance of the GSCI-based ensemble model.",Credit scoring | heterogeneous ensemble | normal fuzzy number | the Choquet integral | the generalized Shapley function,8,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,CAE,2017TP1026,State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems

We propose the Task-Oriented Prediction Network (TOPNet), an end-to-end learning scheme that automatically integrates task-based evaluation criteria into the learning process via a learnable surrogate loss function, which directly guides the model towards the task-based goal. A major benefit of the proposed TOPNet learning scheme lies in its capability of automatically integrating non-differentiable evaluation criteria, which makes it particularly suitable for diversified and customized task-based evaluation criteria in real-world tasks. We validate the performance of TOPNet on two real-world financial prediction tasks, revenue surprise forecasting and credit risk modeling.

Also, the credit risk evaluation is usually made by using the application card scoring model, which has the shortcomings of strict data assumption and inability to process complex data. In order to overcome the limitations of the credit card scoring model and evaluate credit risk better, this paper proposes a credit evaluation model based on extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) machine learning (ML) algorithm to construct a credit risk assessment model for Internet financial institutions. At the same time, an Internet lending company in China is taken as a case study to compare the performance of the traditional credit card scoring model and the proposed machine learning (ML) algorithm model. The results show that ML algorithm has a very significant advantage in the field of Internet financial risk control, it has more accurate prediction results and has no particularly strict assumptions and restrictions on data, and the process of processing data is more convenient and reliable. We should increase the application of ML in the field of financial risk control.

While machine learning techniques such as Neural Networks can have a stunning power of prediction accuracy when done right, the results of such models are not easily interpretable and hence, are difficult to explain and to integrate into financial regulation. Building strong and robust models requires a high degree of expertise, time and testing, and as the list of the available model grows, their complexity also increases. This is why meta-heuristic search and optimization techniques are being built to tackle this task. However, this often means that such models may not be easily interpretable. This work proposes a fast, reproducible pipeline that targets these two salient needs: solid, comparable model-building and reliable interpretability. An automated machine learning process is implemented via Genetic Algorithms to obtain a locally optimal model for our data that is comparable to top Kagglers’ performance for the same classification problem and then, an interpretation engine is added on top to perform sanity checks on our results and identify the most important causals of prediction. This process greatly reduces time, cost and barrier of entry for model-building while providing the reasons for prediction, which can be easily contrasted with expert knowledge to check for correctness and extracting key insights.",Automated Machine Learning | Credit risk | Interpretable machine learning,1,0,,,,undefined,

Firstly, it conducts preprocessing for collected credit data. Then, an efficient feature selection algorithm based on adaptive elastic net is employed to reduce the weakly related or uncorrelated variables to get high-quality training data. Thirdly, a novel ensemble strategy is proposed to make the imbalanced training data set balanced for each extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. Finally, a new weighting method for single ELM classifiers in the ensemble model is established with respect to their classification accuracy based on generalized fuzzy soft sets (GFSS) theory. A novel cosine-based distance measurement algorithm of GFSS is also proposed to calculate the weights of each ELM classifier. To confirm the efficiency of the proposed ensemble credit scoring model, we implemented experiments with real-world credit data sets for comparison. The process of analysis, outcomes, and mathematical tests proved that the proposed model is capable of improving the effectiveness of classification in average accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), H-measure, and Brier's score compared to all other single classifiers and ensemble approaches.",,7,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

These techniques are used mainly for prediction, classification and partitioning data into different groups according to a certain common characteristic. In this work, we are interested in machine learning techniques for credit scoring and bankruptcy prediction in finance and banking. We evaluate and compare a range of machine learning techniques on several datasets issued from banks and financial institutions where the aim is to select the most appropriate methods suitable for each dataset. We use several metrics to evaluate the performance of the obtained models. The empirical studies are conducted on German, Australian, Japanese, Polish, Indian Qualitative Bankruptcy and Taiwan datasets. Also, we consider the huge 'Give Me Some Credit dataset'. The machine learning methods produce scores for applicants and companies and help a lot in the decision making. In other words, these methods permit us to distinguish between bad and good applicants or companies. The numerical study shows that there is no method able to consistently outperform the others on all the datasets. Also, there are significant differences between the studied methods on some datasets. For German and Give Me Some Credit datasets, the Bayes net method is able to produce good scores compared to the others studied methods. The LogitBoost method is competitive on both Polish and Australian datasets, while AdaBoost method is most appropriate for Japanese dataset. For Taiwan dataset, Random Forest method gives the best results compared to the other considered techniques.

In this paper, a weighted soft decision forest (WSDF) model is proposed for credit scoring problem. WSDF tries to simulate the credit scoring mechanism under multiple expert decisions. In the new model, multiple soft decision trees are ensembled by an interpretable weighting mechanism to form a forest.

Lenders train these models on data from previously granted credit applications, where the borrowers’ repayment behavior has been observed. This approach creates sample bias. The scoring model is trained on accepted cases only. Applying the model to screen applications from the population of all borrowers degrades its performance. Reject inference comprises techniques to overcome sampling bias through assigning labels to rejected cases. This paper makes two contributions. First, we propose a self-learning framework for reject inference. The framework is geared toward real-world credit scoring requirements through considering distinct training regimes for labeling and model training. Second, we introduce a new measure to assess the effectiveness of reject inference strategies. Our measure leverages domain knowledge to avoid artificial labeling of rejected cases during evaluation. We demonstrate this approach to offer a robust and operational assessment of reject inference. Experiments on a real-world credit scoring data set confirm the superiority of the suggested self-learning framework over previous reject inference strategies. We also find strong evidence in favor of the proposed evaluation measure assessing reject inference strategies more reliably, raising the performance of the eventual scoring model.",Credit scoring | Evaluation | Reject inference | Self-learning,4,0,,,,undefined,

Borrowers can get financing more easily, but it means higher credit risk to lenders, making credit scoring models a key tool for lending P2P platforms. The goal is to estimate the level risk (being good or bad borrower), from the collected informations of each applicant. One of the classification approaches is Multi dimensional Hidden Markov Model (MDHMM). The MDHMM parameters are usually estimated using Baum-Welch algorithm (BW). However, the Baum-Welch algorithm tends to arrive at local optimal points. In this paper a strategy called Variable neighborhood search (VNS), is proposed to addresses this problem. The hybrid model in which VNS algorithm is coupled with Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter estimation of MDHMM, is applied in credit scoring domain, using real peer-to-peer lending data.

Classifying an applicant as good or bad debtor helps lender to make a wise decision. The modern data mining and machine learning techniques have been found to be very useful and accurate in credit risk predictive capability and correct decision making. Classification is one of the most widely used techniques in machine learning. To increase prediction accuracy of standalone classifiers while keeping overall cost to a minimum, feature selection techniques have been utilized, as feature selection removes redundant and irrelevant attributes from dataset. This paper initially introduces Bolasso (Bootstrap-Lasso) which selects consistent and relevant features from pool of features. The consistent feature selection is defined as robustness of selected features with respect to changes in dataset Bolasso generated shortlisted features are then applied to various classification algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) to test its predictive accuracy. It is observed that Bolasso enabled Random Forest algorithm (BS-RF) provides best results forcredit risk evaluation. The classifiers are built on training and test data partition (70:30) of three datasets (Lending Club's peer to peer dataset, Kaggle's Bank loan status dataset and German credit dataset obtained from UCI). The performance of Bolasso enabled various classification algorithms is then compared with that of other baseline feature selection methods like Chi Square, Gain Ratio, ReliefF and stand-alone classifiers (no feature selection method applied). The experimental results shows that Bolasso provides phenomenal stability of features when compared with stability of other algorithms. Jaccard Stability Measure (JSM) is used to assess stability of feature selection methods. Moreover BS-RF have good classification accuracy and is better than other methods in terms of AUC and Accuracy resulting in effectively improving the decision making process of lenders.",Bootstrap-lasso | BS-RF | Credit risk assessment | Random forest in credit risk | Stable feature selection,86,0,,,,undefined,

The 2008 recession was fueled by poorly underwritten mortgages in which a high percentage of less-credit-worthy borrowers defaulted on their mortgage payments. Although the market has recovered from that collapse, we must avoid the pitfalls of another market meltdown. Greed and overzealous assumptions fueled that crisis and it is imperative that bank underwriters properly assess risks with the assistance of the latest technologies. In this paper, machine learning techniques are utilized to predict the approval or denial of mortgage applicants using predicted risks due to external factors. The mortgage decision is determined by a two-tier machine learning model that examines micro and macro risk exposures. In addition a comparative analysis on approved and declined credit decisions was performed using logistic regression, random forest, adaboost, and deep learning. Throughout this paper multiple models are tested with different machine learning algorithms, but time is the key driver for the final candidate model decision. The results of this study are fascinating and we believe that this technology will offer a unique perspective and add value to banking risk models to reduce mortgage default percentages.",Classification and regression trees | Credit risk | Deep Neural Network | Logistic Regression | Machine Learning Model | Mortgages | Random Forest Classifier,1,0,,,,undefined,

Many standard statistical and machine learning techniques are used in the literature to build credit scoring models from training sets consisting of people in their records who were given loans in the past. Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a new financing channel which is based on electronic business platform and electronic commerce credit. In P2P lending, borrowers and lenders can use the internet platform to achieve online transactions. There is lower transaction cost, while the loan process is simple and easy to operate. Small and micro enterprises and individual borrowers that are difficult to get loans from the bank do not need loan guarantor and collateral in P2P, so they can get financing more easily. But it means higher credit risk to lenders. Many classification methods such as neural networks, support vector machines and random forests, have been suggested in the literature to improve credit scoring models in terms of their statistical performance. But there execution time can grow exponentially with the size of the instances, especially with the grow of Big Data sources like mobile phone data and social network data for credit scoring applications [18]. For these cases, metaheuristics like Hidden Markov Model (HMM) present a good alternative solution technique. A limitation of HMM is that it only supports one observed random variable. In case of the credit scoring, there are more variables that are relevant to the estimation. Multi dimensional Hidden Markov Model (MDHMM) extends hidden Markov model by supporting multiple observed variables. The iterative procedure of MDHMM greatly simplifies parallelized implementation and computations of innovative Big Data sources in credit scoring. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of MDHMM to addresses the credit scoring problem in Peer-To-Peer (P2P) lending. The performance of the proposed MDHMM method is validated on Lending Club (Peer-to-peer lending) credit dataset.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

A key challenge facing P2P lending platforms is accurately predicting the default probability of the borrower of each loan using the default prediction model, which effectively helps the P2P lending platform avoid credit risks. The traditional default prediction model based on machine learning and statistical learning does not meet the needs of P2P lending platforms in terms of default risk prediction because for data-driven P2P lending, credit data have a large number of missing values, are high-dimensional and have class-imbalanced problems, which makes it difficult to effectively train the default risk prediction model. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new default risk prediction model based on heterogeneous ensemble learning. Three individual classifiers, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a deep neural network (DNN) and logistic regression (LR), are used simultaneously with a liner weight ensemble strategy. In particular, this model is able to process missing values. After generating discrete and rank features, this model adds missing values to the model for self-training. Then, the hyperparameters are optimized by the XGBoost model to improve the performance of the prediction model. Finally, compared with the benchmark model, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction results.

Motivated by this scenario, we evaluate several classification approaches to credit scoring. Besides, we also assess some preprocessing methods to overcome skewed datasets. To achieve it, we use three public real-world credit scoring datasets. In our experiments, we progressively increase the class imbalance in each of these datasets by randomly undersampling the minority class of defaulters to identify how the predictive power is affected.

However, credit risk remains inevitable. A key challenge is creating a default prediction model that can effectively and accurately predict the default probability of each loan for a P2P lending platform. Due to the characteristics of P2P lending credit data, such as high dimension and class imbalance, conventional statistical models and machine learning algorithms cannot effectively and accurately predict default probability. To address this issue, a decision tree model-based heterogeneous ensemble default prediction model is proposed in this paper for accurate prediction of customer default in P2P lending. Gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) are employed as individual classifiers to create a heterogeneous ensemble learning-based default prediction model. Learning model-based feature ranking is applied to P2P lending credit data, and individual classifiers undergo hyperparameter optimization. Finally, comparison with benchmark models shows that the prediction model can achieve desirable prediction results and thus effectively solve the challenge of predictions based on high-dimensional and imbalanced data.",Default prediction | High-dimensional data | Imbalanced data | Machine learning | P2P lending,44,0,,,NSFC,61773286,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In such an ever-changing economy as the rate of loan defaults are gradually increasing, authorities of financial institutions are finding it more and more difficult to correctly assess loan requests and tackle the risks of loan defaulters. In light of these events this paper proposes a machine learning model which can precisely assess credit risk and predict possible loan defaulters for credit lending institutions. A comparative analysis has been made using tuned supervised learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression for identifying defaulters. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation and Principal Component Analysis have been used for dimensionality reduction. Metrics such as F1 score, AUC score, prediction accuracy, precision and recall have been used to evaluate each model. Among all the models, the combination of a tuned Support Vector Machine and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation have shown great promise in identifying loan defaulters. The proposed model, therefore, can assist financial institutions in accurately identifying loan defaulters and prevent them from incurring further loss.",Credit Risk | Extreme Gradient Boosting | Loan Assessment | Logistic Regression | Machine Learning | Random Forest | SVM,18,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Three hybrid artificial intelligent models, including (1) decision tree-artificial neural network (ANN), (2) decision tree-logistic regression, and (3) decision tree-dynamic Bayesian network have been investigated. The models were trained using sellers credit cases from Taobao, which has 609 cases, and each case had 23 categorical and numerical attributes. The results suggest that the combination of decision tree-ANN provides the highest accuracy, which can promote healthy and fast transactions between buyers and sellers on the platforms. This model is regarded as a powerful tool that allows us to build an advanced credit risk evaluation system, and meet the requirements of the platform transaction mode to be dynamic and self-learning-which will ultimately contribute to the sustainable development of the e-commerce ecosystem.

The predictive capabilities of the models were compared to identify default-prediction mechanisms in the “My Home, My Life” Program (Programa “Minha Casa, Minha Vida” — PMCMV). The PMCMV is one of the largest government initiatives in the world to finance home ownership in the low-income population. Implemented by the Brazilian government, the programme has provided financing in excess of USD 84 billion and by 2016 had already contracted for the construction of over 4.5 million housing units, with 3.3 million units already delivered. The models developed in this study involve different time intervals for default prediction as well as analysis without the use of traditional discriminatory variables (gender, age, and marital status). Three measurements were used to evaluate the quality of the prediction models: area under the ROC curve, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov index, and the Brier score. The results indicated that (1) the accuracy of the models improves as the number of days overdue used to define the default variable increases; (2) the best prediction results were obtained with traditional ensemble techniques — in this case Bagging (BG), Random Forest (RF), and Boosting; and (3) there was a negative impact on all criteria when a smaller number of observations was used, especially on the type II error. It was also found that the discriminatory power of the credit risk rating system is preserved when removing discriminatory variables from the models. Applying the BG algorithm, which is the best prediction method, a default rate of 11.80% could be reduced to 2.95%, which leads to a selection that would result in 197,905 fewer delinquent contracts in the PMCMV, thus representing a savings of approximately USD 3.0 billion in credit losses.",Credit risk | Default prediction | Low-income housing program | Machine learning | Predictive performance measures,20,0,,,CNPq,310666/2016-3,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico

Time series of historical valuation parameters and prices of the portfolio’s constituents serve as the only inputs. On the example of a variety of portfolios comprising vanilla and barrier options, it is demonstrated that, even with limited training sets, GPR leads to risk figures identical to those from full revaluation and outperforms Taylor expansion.

However, the credit as well as financial data generally comprises unwanted and repetitive features which lead to inefficient classification performance. To overcome this issue, in this paper, a new financial credit scoring (FCS) prediction model is developed by incorporating the process of outlier detection (OD) process (i.e. misclassified instance removal) prior to data classification. The presented FCS model involves two main phases namely misclassified instance removal using Naïve Bayes (NB) Tree and Random Tree (RT) based data classification.

In this work, we propose a combination strategy of integrating unsupervised learning with supervised learning for credit risk assessment. The difference between our work and other previous work on unsupervised integration is that we apply unsupervised learning techniques at two different stages: the consensus stage and dataset clustering stage. Comparisons of model performance are performed based on three credit datasets in four groups: individual models, individual models + consensus model, clustering + individual models, clustering + individual models + consensus model. As a result, integration at either the consensus stage or dataset clustering stage is effective on improving the performance of credit scoring models. Moreover, the combination of the two stages achieves the best performance, thereby confirming the superiority of the proposed integration of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, which boost our confidence that this strategy can be extended to many other credit datasets from financial institutions.",Credit scoring | Ensemble model | Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) | Supervised machine learning | Unsupervised machine learning,64,0,,,UC,71271032,University of California

To mitigate the negative effects of imbalanced datasets on the performance of the credit evaluation model, the SMOTE technique is used to rebalance the target training dataset. The particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm is employed to search for the best-connected weights and deviations in the BP neural networks. Based on the optimised BP neural network classifiers, an ensemble model is developed that combines the AdaBoost approach with the base classifiers. To ensure that the proposed model provides accurate and stable performance, we thoroughly explore and discuss the optimal parameters for the ensemble classification model.

The purpose of this paper is to use the statistics of the CAP curve to provide a new method for credit PD curves calibration that are not based on arbitrary choices as the ones that are used in the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The author maps CAP curves to a ball–box problem and uses statistical physics techniques to compute the statistics of the CAP curve from which the author derives the shape of PD curves. Findings: This approach leads to a new type of shape for PD curves that have not been considered in the literature yet, namely, the Fermi–Dirac function which is a two-parameter function depending on the target default rate of the portfolio and the target accuracy ratio of the scoring model. The author shows that this type of PD curve shape is likely to outperform the logistic PD curve that practitioners often use. Practical implications: This paper has some practical implications for practitioners in banks. The author shows that the logistic function which is widely used, in particular in the field of retail banking, should be replaced by the Fermi–Dirac function. This has an impact on pricing, the granting policy and risk management. Social implications: Measuring credit risk accurately benefits the bank of course and the customers as well. Indeed, granting is based on a fair evaluation of risk, and pricing is done accordingly. Additionally, it provides better tools to supervisors to assess the risk of the bank and the financial system as a whole through the stress testing exercises.

The results of the analysis were compared with those of the Japanese yen and Korean won, the latter of which is a non-international currency. The analysis was conducted from January 2013 to December 2017. The relationship between the national CDS premiums of China, Japan and Korea, as well as their spot exchange rates, the forward exchange rates, the interest rate of US Treasury bond which is a variable in the global financial market, credit risk spread, VIX index and TED spread, were analyzed through VECM model analysis, Granger causality analysis, impulse response analysis, and variance decomposition analysis. The results of the analysis are as follows: first, there was a long-term cointegration balance relation between the country CDS premiums of China, Japan and Korea and the analytic variables. Second, the Granger causality analysis revealed a significant feedback between the change rate of CDS, as well as that of the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate in China and Korea, and Korean won showed stronger intensity. However, no relation was found between the CDS premium in Japan and its spot exchange rate and forward exchange rate. Third, the error correction term of the VECM model between the CDS premiums and analytical variables of Korea and China was negative and significant, whereas the value of the Japanese error correction term was not significant. Fourth, the impulse response function analysis showed that the CDS premium in China continued to receive positive impacts from the global variables, but the adjustment process of the CDS in Korea was revealed to with its reverse from positive (+) to negative Fifth, the result of variance decomposition analysis showed that the VIX index had a strong explanatory power on the CDS of China, whereas in case of Korea, the explanatory power was strong on the CDS of the offshore forward exchange rate. Overall, the CDS in China was dominated by the global market variables rather than the yuan exchange rate; on the other hand, in the case of country CDS of Korea, the won-dollar exchange rate and the global market variables exchanged mutual impacts, and the intensity was also grater than that of the offshore yuan currency. However, the Japanese CDS had no causal relationship with the yen currency, because the foreign exchange market and the government bond market were fully liberalized. The implications of this study are as follows; In regards of the CDS premium of a country, not only the domestic but also the global financial market has risen in its importance; and while the impact of the global financial market on the yen and the won can be distributed to the CDS market and foreign exchange market, the impact on the offshore yuan currency can be focused on the CDS market. This has provided a significant information that although yuan is an SDR international currency to the participants in international financial markets, but it could still be sensitive to the impacts in changing financial market conditions, because its characteristics as a non-international currency still exist.",CDS | KRW | NDF KRW | RMB-CNH | VIX,1,0,,,,undefined,

Moreover, client credit assessment data are naturally asymmetric and class imbalanced because of the screening of clients. Aiming at solving the joint research issue of concept drift and class imbalance in client credit assessments, in this paper, a novel sample-based online learning ensemble (SOLE) for client credit assessment is proposed. A novel multiple time scale ensemble classifier and a novel sample-based online class imbalance learning procedure are proposed to handle the potential concept drift and class imbalance in the client credit assessment data streams. The experiments are carried out on two real-world client credit assessment cases, which present a comprehensive comparison between the proposed SOLE and other state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. In addition, the base classifier preference and the computing resource consumption of all the comparative algorithms are tested. In general, SOLE achieves a better performance than other methods using fewer computing resources.

Also, increasingly more credit decisions are being taken today. Furthermore, millennials’ service expectations drive transformation from traditional lending into digital lending. The CAGR for digital lending is 53 per cent until 2025. Therefore, in this growing information age, new methods for credit risk scoring could form the central pillar for the continuity of a financial institution and the stability of the global financial system. This paper contains research from across the UK and the Netherlands: two advanced lending markets, selected because of their advancements in digital lending, to examine to what extent lenders can advance their credit decisions with individual risk assessments with artificial intelligence (AI). The research has applied supervised learning and has been performed on 133,152 mortgage and credit card customers in prime, near prime and sub-prime lending segments of three European lenders across the UK and the Netherlands during the period January 2016 to July 2017. As candidate models, we chose neural nets and random forests, as they are the most popular supervised learning methods in credit risk for their benefit of applying both structured and unstructured data. The research describes three experiments that develop the AI probability of default models and compares the model quality with the quality of the traditional applied logistic probability of default (PD) models.

Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations to avert another market collapse, such as the collateralization of interbank (counterparty) derivatives trades to mitigate systemic risk. A limiting factor is the availability of proprietary bank trading data. Even if this hurdle could be overcome, however, analyses would still be hampered by segmented financial markets where banks trade under different regulatory systems. We therefore adapt a simulation technology, combining advances in graph theoretic models and machine learning to randomly generate entire financial systems derived from realistic distributions of bank trading data. We then compute counterparty credit risk under various scenarios to evaluate and predict the impact of financial regulations at all levels—from a single trade to individual banks to systemic risk. We find that under various stress testing scenarios collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations. Moreover, the concentration of credit risk does not necessarily correlate monotonically with systemic risk. While the analysis focuses on counterparty credit risk, the method generalizes to other risks and metrics in a straightforward manner.",artificial intelligence | data science | financial regulation | financial risk analytics | graph theoretic models | machine learning | stochastic Linear Gauss-Markov model | systemic risk,13,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Nevertheless, traditional credit risk forecasting models cannot meet the needs of such forecasting. Many researchers argue that machine learning (ML) approaches are good tools.

The forecasting result shows that RS-MultiBoosting has good performance in dealing with a small sample size.

We also extend genetic algorithm, i.e., propose an enhanced multi-population niche genetic algorithm (EMPNGA), to improve the ability of optimization effectively by enhancing the selection, crossover, and mutation steps, and adding niche and migration steps. Furthermore, EMPNGA is applied to combine several filter methods and priori knowledge in feature selection and classifier selection respectively to further increase the search efficiency. The proposed model is applied to credit scoring to verify its prediction performance. Finally, five datasets and four evaluation metrics are applied in the experiment. The experimental results confirm that the performance of proposed model is superior to the other comparative models, proving that this study is of significance and effectiveness.",Classifier selection | Credit scoring | Feature selection | Machine learning | Multi-stage hybrid model,90,0,,,NSFC,51475410,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Ensembles of classifiers have demonstrated their effectiveness for various applications in finance using data sets that are often characterized by imperfections such as irrelevant features, skewed classes, data set shift, and missing and noisy data. However, there are other corruptions in the data that might hinder the prediction performance mainly on the default or bankrupt (positive) cases, where the misclassification costs are typically much higher than those associated to the non-default or non-bankrupt (negative) class. Here we characterize the complexity of 14 real-life financial databases based on the different types of positive samples. The objective is to gain some insight into the potential links between the performance of classifier ensembles (BAGGING, AdaBoost, random subspace, DECORATE, rotation forest, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting) and the positive sample types.

The main challenge for individual investors in the P2P lending market is to allocate their money efficiently through different loans by accurately evaluating the credit of each loan. The traditional ranking models cannot conform to the needs of individual investors in P2P lending because they do not provide natural mechanisms for asset allocation. P2P loans do not have the presence of traditional financial institutions. In this study, we propose a novel method for analyzing data for this emerging market. We have designed a credit risk model based on advanced machine learning methods, capable of assessing the returns and risks of individual loans. We also applied a selection feature method to eliminate the irrelevant features for improving the efficient of machine learning models.

In the insurance industry an important question arises, namely: how can insurance renewal prices be adjusted? Such an adjustment has two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, insurers are forced to retain existing customers, while on the other hand insurers are also forced to increase revenue. Intuitively, one might assume that revenue increases by offering high renewal prices, however this might also cause many customers to terminate their contracts. Contrarily, low renewal prices help retain most existing customers, but could negatively affect revenue. Therefore, adjusting renewal prices is a non-trivial problem for the insurance industry. In this paper, we propose a novel modelization of the renewal price adjustment problem as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, as a Markov decision process (MDP). In particular, this study analyzes two different strategies to carry out this adjustment. The first is about maximizing revenue analyzing the effect of this maximization on customer retention, while the second is about maximizing revenue subject to the client retention level not falling below a given threshold. The former case is related to MDPs with a single criterion to be optimized. The latter case is related to Constrained MDPs (CMDPs) with two criteria, where the first one is related to optimization, while the second is subject to a constraint. This paper also contributes with the resolution of these models by means of a model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Results have been reported using real data from the insurance division of BBVA, one of the largest Spanish companies in the banking sector.",Pricing strategy optimization | Reinforcement learning,26,0,repositoryam,Green,MINECO,2016-T2/TIC-1712,Comunidad de Madrid

In this paper, we propose a new dynamic weighted ensemble method for credit scoring. Markov Chain is employed to model the change of each classifier’s classification ability and build a dynamic weighted trainable combiner, which dynamically assign weights to the base classifiers for each sample in the testing set. Through eight credit data sets from the real world, the experimental study demonstrates the ability and efficiency of the dynamic weighted ensemble method to improve prediction performance against the benchmark models, including some well-known individual classifiers and dynamic ensemble methods.

Therefore, our main goal in this study is to establish a new benchmark using real consumer data and to provide machine-learning approaches that can serve as a baseline on this benchmark. We performed an extensive comparison between the machine-learning approaches and a human expert-based model-FICO credit scoring system-by using a Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data.

We then built regression models based on various machine-learning algorithms ranging from logistic regression and support vector machines to an ensemble of gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. Our results demonstrated that if lending institutions in the 2001s had used their own credit scoring model constructed by machine-learning methods explored in this study, their expected credit losses would have been lower, and they would be more sustainable.

Because of growing market and increasing the loan applications, this field still continues its concern in terms of rating the applicants and assessing the credit amounts. To reduce the number of wrong decisions in the credit evaluation process, the decision makers focus on estimating more robust models. However, the traditional methods are criticized due to various pre-requisites and linear approximations in the high dimensional and excessive nonlinear cases. For this reason, artificial intelligence techniques are mostly preferred to handle the credit scoring problems accurately. This study presents an efficient procedure that is based on ANNs with cross-entropy and fuzzy relations in the context of the credit scoring.

We cooperate with an AI solution provider whose AI-based credit scoring models are widely used by online lenders in China. Using data obtained from these online lenders, we find that AI-based credit scoring models increase approval rate and reduce default rate simultaneously, which enhances both the magnitude and the quality of financial inclusion. AI-based credit scoring models also tend to reduce false rejection rate, suggesting that they can help provide access to capital to previously underserved population.

Building an ensemble learning model that has been proven to be typically more accurate and robust than individual classifiers, it is an important information management task of commercial banks and loan lenders. In this paper, a novel noise-adapted two-layer ensemble model for credit scoring based on backflow learning is proposed, in which five widely used base classifiers, i.e., extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, and linear discriminant analysis, are integrated. To amplify the strength and diversity of the base classifiers, a new backflow learning approach is proposed so that the base classifiers will relearn the misclassified data point. A final predictive result is obtained by fusing the prediction of all base classifiers through two-layer ensemble modeling. In addition, considering that noise data are a major problem that aggravates the accuracy of a predictive model, a new noise adaption approach based on the isolation forest algorithm is proposed to address noise data. It first calculates the outlier score of each data point to detect the noise data that are subsequently boosted in the training set to form the noise-adapted training set. Three credit datasets from the UCI machine learning repository are tested to compare the performance of the proposed model with those of other benchmark models. The experimental results prove that our proposed model outperforms other models by demonstrating satisfactory improvement in various performance measures.",Backflow learning | Credit scoring | Ensemble model | Feature engineering | Machine learning | Noise adaption,19,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,51475410,National Natural Science Foundation of China

CS is a score measure that helps lenders and creditors to see how good the borrower is. It indicates how likely the borrower is to pay back the owed debt, based on its past borrowing behavior. For instance, this score can be used to avoid risk and provide an objective analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness which reduces credit risk. Also CS allows the automation of the lending process which leads to increase the speed and consistency of the borrower’s application. In this paper, we propose to use agents’ technology to develop a cooperative classification system for credit scoring. Empirical studies are conducted on five well-known financial datasets. We distribute the complex classification problem on a set of intelligent and cooperative agents where each agent evaluates a given machine learning algorithm on the considered dataset. The use of agents in the classification process provides a high degree of flexibility and allows for a faster time scale of data analysis.",Cooperative agents | Credit risk | Credit scoring | Financial datasets | Intelligent agents | Machine learning,1,0,,,,undefined,

Using records from a Brazilian financial institution, this study uses a database of 5,432 companies that are clients of the bank, where 2,600 clients are classified as non-defaulters, 1,551 are classified as defaulters and 1,281 are temporarily defaulters, meaning that the clients are overdue on their payments for up 180 days. For each case, a total of 15 attributes was considered for a one-against-all assessment using four different techniques: Artificial Neural Networks Multilayer Perceptron (ANN-MLP), Artificial Neural Networks Radial Basis Functions (ANN-RBF), Logistic Regression (LR) and finally Support Vector Machines (SVM). For each method, different parameters were analyzed in order to obtain different results when the best of each technique was compared. Initially the data were coded in thermometer code (numerical attributes) or dummy coding (for nominal attributes). The methods were then evaluated for each parameter and the best result of each technique was compared in terms of accuracy, false positives, false negatives, true positives and true negatives. This comparison showed that the best method, in terms of accuracy, was ANN-RBF (79.20% for non-defaulter classification, 97.74% for defaulters and 75.37% for the temporarily defaulter classification). However, not always did the best accuracy represent the best technique for the assessment of this problem. For instance, on the classification of temporarily defaulters, this technique, in terms of false positives, was surpassed by SVM, which had the lowest rate (0.07%) of false positive classifications.

One of the most important issue in lending business is to measure the risk that the borrower will default or delay in loan payment. This is called credit risk. After Lehman shock in 2008–2009, big banks increased verification for lending operation to reduce risk. As borrowing from established financial institutions is getting harder, social lending also called Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, is becoming the popular trend. Because the client information at P2P lending is not sufficient as in traditional financial system, big data and machine learning become the default methods for analyzing credit risk. However, cost of computation and the problem of training the classifier with imbalance data affect the quality of result. This paper proposes a machine learning model with feature selection to measure credit risk of individual borrower on P2P lending. Based on our experimental results, we showed that the credit risk prediction for P2P lending can be improved using Logistic Regression in addition to proper feature selection.",Credit risk | Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) | Logistic Regression | Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) | P2P lending,4,0,,,,undefined,

Such an automation allows who work and offer services in the financial area to take quick decisions with regard to different services, first and foremost those concerning the consumer credit, whose requests have exponentially increased over the last years. In order to face some well-known problems related to the state-of-the-art credit scoring approaches, this paper formalizes a novel data model that we called Discretized Enriched Data (DED), which operates by transforming the original feature space in order to improve the performance of the credit scoring machine learning algorithms. The idea behind the proposed DED model revolves around two processes, the first one aimed to reduce the number of feature patterns through a data discretization process, and the second one aimed to enrich the discretized data by adding several meta-features. The data discretization faces the problem of heterogeneity, which characterizes such a domain, whereas the data enrichment works on the related loss of information by adding meta-features that improve the data characterization. Our model has been evaluated in the context of real-world datasets with different sizes and levels of data unbalance, which are considered a benchmark in credit scoring literature. The obtained results indicate that it is able to improve the performance of one of the most performing machine learning algorithm largely used in this field, opening up new perspectives for the definition of more effective credit scoring solutions.",Algorithms | Business Intelligence | Credit Scoring | Decision Support System | Machine Learning,9,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,MIUR,CUP F74G14000200008 F19G14000910008,Nvidia

This paper proposes a hybrid of the simulated annealing and the extreme gradient boosting machine models in order to predict the likelihood of default payments based on users' finance histories. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model demonstrates its predictability with high recall scores.

This costly process has been automated in earlier studies by using systems based on machine learning methods. However, such systems suffer from interpretability issues and do not utilize expert knowledge effectively. To overcome those problems, multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methods have recently been used to simulate the assessment process performed by the committee of multiple credit risk experts. However, standard MCGDM methods fail to consider high uncertainty inherently associated with the assessment and do not work effectively when the assessed credit risk criteria interact with each other. To address these issues, we propose MCGDM model for bank credit risk assessment that has two advantages: (1) The imprecise assessment criteria are represented by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and (2) the interactions among the criteria are modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. When combined with traditional TOPSIS approach to ranking alternatives, we show that the proposed model can be effectively applied to assess bank credit risk.",Bank credit risk assessment | Decision support system | Fuzzy cognitive maps | Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets | TOPSIS,6,0,,,,16-19590S,

To support decisionmaking on granting P2P loans, diverse machine learning methods have been used in P2P credit risk models. However, such models have been limited to loan default prediction, without considering the financial impact of the loans. Loss given default (LGD) is used in modelling consumer credit risk to address this issue. Earlier approaches to modelling LGDin P2P lending tended to usemultivariate linear regression methods in order to identify the determinants of P2P loans’ credit risk. Here, we showthat thesemethods are not effective enough to process complex features present in P2P lending data.We propose a novel decision support system to LGD modeling in P2P lending. To reduce the problem of overfitting, the system uses random forest (RF) learning in two stages. First, extremely risky loans with LGD = 1 are identified using classification RF. Second, the LGD of the remaining P2P loans is predicted using regression RF. Thus, the non-normal distribution of the LGD values can be effectively modelled. We demonstrate that the proposed system is effective for the benchmark of P2P Lending Club platform as other methods currently used in LGD modelling are outperformed.",Credit risk | Loss given default | Peer-to-peer lending | Random forests,5,0,,,,19-15498S,

Second, base classifiers can be self-adaptively selected from the candidate classifier repository according to their performance in datasets and their parameters are optimized by the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Third, the ensemble model is integrated through these optimized base classifiers, and it can generate new features through multi-layer stacking and obtain the classifier weights in the ensemble model through the particle swarm optimization.

The proposed work aims to identify and distinguish the good customers from bad customers by using different machine learning techniques. Two different tools Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) and KNIME (Konstanz Information Miner) are used for analyzing the performance of the classifiers. The main focus of this work is the prediction of credit card defaulters and hence two data sets relating to the credit card data of customers have been used for the purpose of this study. The results obtained from the proposed work can help the financial institutions in the identification and control of credit risk.",Classification | Machine learning techniques | Risk management,6,0,,,,undefined,

The emotional/social credit score is based on analysis and study of social media and other web interaction. The new system called information trustworthiness is developed to improve the precision of social media data when compared with data from reliable sources. Finally, the proper fractions of legacy credit score and emotional/social credit score are added to get Advanced Credit Score. This score is more precise than Legacy credit score as it also incorporates personality traits of an individual which have a high impact on one's financial behavior. However, the accuracy of the Advanced Credit Score is dependent on the fractions of legacy credit score and emotional/social credit score selected. The advance scoring system can be effectively used to distinguish people who defaulted many times and who never used loans or services like credit cards which are otherwise not possible using legacy financial credit scoring system.",Credit score | CRISP-DM | data mining | Multilayer Perceptron | Naive Bayes | Random Forest | Random Tree,14,0,,,,undefined,

The number of repaid loans is higher than that of defaulted ones. Therefore, the classification of these data is biased toward the majority class, which practically means that it tends to attribute a mistaken “good borrower” status even to “very risky borrowers”. In addition to the use of statistics and machine learning classifiers, this paper aims to explore the relevance and performance of sampling models combined with statistical prediction and artificial intelligence techniques to predict and quantify the default probability based on real-world credit data. Design/methodology/approach: A real database from a Tunisian commercial bank was used and unbalanced data issues were addressed by the random over-sampling (ROS) and synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). Performance was evaluated in terms of the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic curve. Findings: The results indicated that the combination of intelligent and statistical techniques and re-sampling approaches are promising for the default rate management and provide accurate credit risk estimates. Originality/value: This paper empirically investigates the effectiveness of ROS and SMOTE in combination with logistic regression, artificial neural networks and support vector machines.

However, the loan evaluation model based on Random Forest aims to improve the overall accuracy, which cannot guarantee that the lender profit is maximized when the overall accuracy is maximized because the profits of each loan are different. To further improve the loan evaluation effect and lender profits, Random Forest optimized using a genetic algorithm with profit score (RFoGAPS) is proposed. First, considering the actual and potential returns and losses, a new profit score is proposed and taken as the optimization objective. Second, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the combination of decision trees in Random Forest. Then, the dataset of Lending Club is used to evaluate the proposed method.

Semi-supervised learning constitutes an appropriate machine- learning methodology for extracting useful knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled data.

In this study, we consider data-driven customer targeting in an incentive-based residential demand response program, and investigate the explainability-performance tradeoff when using simple-rule based, machine learning, and credit scoring methods.

The primary aim of this work is to develop a CS model to replace the pre-risk check of the e-commerce risk management system Risk Solution Services (RSS), which is currently one of the most used systems to estimate customers’ default probability. The pre-risk check uses data from the order process and includes exclusion rules and a generic CS model. The new model is supposed to replace the whole pre-risk check and has to work both in isolation and in integration with the RSS main risk check. An application of genetic programming (GP) to CS is presented in this paper. The model was developed on a real-world dataset provided by a well-known German financial solutions company. The dataset contains order requests processed by RSS. The results show that GP outperforms the generic CS model of the pre-risk check in both classification accuracy and profit.

Various statistics-based machine learning techniques have been employed for this task. “Curse of Dimensionality” is still a significant challenge in machine learning techniques. Some research has been carried out on Feature Selection (FS) using genetic algorithm as wrapper to improve the performance of credit scoring models. However, the challenge lies in finding an overall best method in credit scoring problems and improving the time-consuming process of feature selection. In this study, the credit scoring problem is investigated through feature selection to improve classification performance. This work proposes a novel approach to feature selection in credit scoring applications, called as Information Gain Directed Feature Selection algorithm (IGDFS), which performs the ranking of features based on information gain, propagates the top m features through the GA wrapper (GAW) algorithm using three classical machine learning algorithms of KNN, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for credit scoring. The first stage of information gain guided feature selection can help reduce the computing complexity of GA wrapper, and the information gain of features selected with the IGDFS can indicate their importance to decision making. Regarding the classification accuracy, SVM accuracy is always better than KNN and NB for Baseline techniques, GAW and IGDFS. Also, we can conclude that the IGDFS achieved better performance than generic GAW, and GAW obtained better performance than the corresponding single classifiers (baseline) for almost all cases, except for the German Credit dataset, IGDFS + KNN has worse performance than generic GAW and the single classifier KNN. Removing features with low information gain could produce conflict with the original data structure for KNN, and thus affect the performance of IGDFS + KNN. Regarding the ROC performance, for the German Credit Dataset, the three classic machine learning algorithms, SVM, KNN and Naïve Bayes in the wrapper of IGDFS GA obtained almost the same performance. For the Australian credit dataset and the Taiwan Credit dataset, the IGDFS + Naive Bayes achieved the largest area under ROC curves.",Accuracy | Credit scoring | Feature selection | Genetic algorithm in wrapper | Information gain | K nearest neighbour clustering | Naive Bayes classifier | ROC curve | Support vector machine,183,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

One of the most important risks affecting the banking sector is the concept of credit risk. The banks try to make sure that the customers are well-financed and they can repay the given loans. But nowadays, as the number of people who use credit from banks reach to millions, trusting and customer-based lending process is very difficult. For this reason, techniques which are called credit scoring techniques and which measure whether given credit or not to customers using customer information are widely used among banks today. In this study, algorithms that can be used in credit scoring systems are examined. Within the scope of the study, a prototype implementation was developed that would facilitate the approval or denial of credit requests by customers. The developed application presents a comparison of commonly used machine learning methods with deep learning methods such as Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Multilayer Artificial Neural Networks.

Banking systems have strong processes in place for identification of customers with poor credit risk scores; however, most of the credit scoring models need to be constantly updated with newer variables and statistical techniques for improved accuracy. While totally eliminating default is almost impossible, loan risk teams, however, minimize the rate of default, thereby protecting banks from the adverse effects of loan default. Credit scoring models have used logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis for identification of potential defaulters. Newer and contemporary machine learning techniques have the ability to outperform classic old age techniques. This article aims to conduct empirical analysis on publically available bank loan dataset to study banking loan default using decision tree as the base learner and comparing it with ensemble tree learning techniques such as bagging, boosting, and random forests. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that the gradient boosting model outperforms the base decision tree learner, indicating that ensemble model works better than individual models.

Traditional approaches, such as regulatory capital ratios, have proven inadequate, giving rise to stress-testing as a primary tool. The macroeconomic variables that supervisors provide to institutions for exercises such as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) programme represent a critical input into this. A common approach to segment-level modelling is statistical regression, like vector autoregression (VAR), to exploit the dependency structure between macroeconomic drivers and modelling segments. However, linear models such as VAR are unable to model distributions that deviate from normality. This paper proposes a challenger approach in the machine-learning class of models, widely used in the academic literature, but not commonly employed in practice: the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model. The study empirically tests these models using Fed Y-9 filings and macroeconomic data, released by the regulators for CCAR purposes. The champion MARS model is validated through a rigorous comparison against the VAR model, and is found to exhibit greater accuracy and superior out-of-sample performance, according to various metrics across all modelling segments.

This method provides a score ranging from 300 to 850 as a fast filter for high-volume complex credit decisions. However, it falls short in the aspect of a decision support system where revised scoring can be achieved to reflect the borrower’s strength and weakness in each scoring dimension, as well as the possible trade-offs made to maintain one’s lending risk. Hence, this study discusses and develops a decision support tool for credit score model based on multi-criteria decision-making principles. In the proposed methodology, criteria weights are generated by fuzzy AHP. Fuzzy linguistic theory is applied in AHP to describe the uncertainties and vagueness arising from human subjectivity in decision making.

Selective ensembles, an important part of this group of systems, are a promising field of research. However, none of them considers the relative costs of Type I error and Type II error for credit scoring when selecting classifiers, which bring higher risks for the financial institutions. Moreover, earlier dynamic selective ensembles usually select and combine classifiers for each test sample dynamically based on classifiers’ performance in the validation set, regardless of their behaviors in the testing set. To fill the gap and overcome the limitations, we propose a new dynamic ensemble classification method for credit scoring based on soft probability. In this method, the classifiers are first selected based on their classification ability and the relative costs of Type I error and Type II error in the validation set. With the selected classifiers, we combine different classifiers for the samples in the testing set based on their classification results to get an interval probability of default by using soft probability.

Accordingly, researchers have developed a myriad of approaches, including statistical and artificial intelligence techniques, to fulfill the task of credit scoring.

In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous ensemble credit model that integrates the bagging algorithm with the stacking method. The proposed model differs from the extant ensemble credit models in three aspects, namely, pool generation, selection of base learners, and trainable fuser. Four popular evaluation metrics, including accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), AUC-H measure, and Brier score, are employed to measure the performance of alternative models. To confirm the efficiency of the proposed bstacking approach, a wide range of models, including individual classifiers, homogeneous ensemble model, and heterogeneous ensemble model, are introduced as benchmarks.

Existing techniques by default uses 0.5 as the cutoff irrespective of datasets and classifiers to predict the binary outcomes, thus limiting their classification performance on imbalanced group sizes of datasets. This paper addresses two key problems with the existing techniques and talks about the advantages of using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique on multiple evaluation criteria. The first key problem is applying default cutoff irrespective of datasets and classifiers. The second one is utilizing single criteria for evaluating classification performance and predicting cutoff point. This research work identifies the best cutoff point with respect to datasets and classifiers and integrates MCDM under fuzzy environment in all data mining stages of evaluation to take better decisions on multiple criteria, selection of initial random seed in the clustering phase for better cluster quality and Best Seed Clustering combined Classification (BSCC hybrid algorithm) with selected features to improve classification performance. The integration of these techniques gives a better hand to improve cluster quality and classification performance score with respect to datasets and classifiers because the cutoff point varies from dataset to dataset and classifiers to classifiers. Experimental outcomes from applied credit dataset of UCI machine learning repository found to be competitive and the proposed BSCC hybrid algorithm increases the performance score on obtained cutoff point over non-hybrid approach with default cutoff.",Classification | Clustering | Credit risk | Cutoff point | Fuzzy MCDM | Random seed,6,0,,,,undefined,

In P2P lending marketplaces, one of the crucial challenges that P2P online lending platforms are facing is to accurately predict the default risk of each loan by tapping into default prediction models, thus effectively helping P2P lending companies avoid credit risks. That traditional credit risk prediction models fail to meet the demand of P2P lending companies for default risk prediction, which is because of the uneven distribution of credit data samples in the P2P lending marketplaces (i.e., the default sampled data are scarce). In this paper, we designed a multi-round ensemble learning model based on heterogeneous ensemble frameworks to predict default risk. In this model, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is initially used for ensemble learning, and the XGBoost, deep neural network, and logistic regression are then regarded as heterogeneous individual learners to undergo a linear weighted fusion. To verify the designed default risk prediction model, real credit data from a famous P2P online lending marketplace in China were used in a test. The results of the experiment indicate that this model can effectively increase the predictive accuracy compared with traditional machine learning models and ensemble learning models.",default prediction | Ensemble learning | imbalanced data | P2P lending,41,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,71571058,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Many credit scoring models based on machine learning have been widely used. Such as artificial neural network (ANN), rough set, support vector machine (SVM), and other innovative credit scoring models. However, in practical applications, a large amount of irrelevant and redundant features in the credit data, which leads to higher computational complexity and lower prediction accuracy. So, the face of a large number of credit data, effective feature selection method is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel credit scoring model, called NCSM, based on feature selection and grid search to optimize random forest algorithm. The model reduces the influence of the irrelevant and redundant features and to get the higher prediction accuracy. In NCSM, the information entropy is regarded as the heuristic to select the optimal feature. Two credit data sets in UCI database are used as experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of the NCSM.

Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are the two main aspects considered in financial distress prediction. To assist in this determination, thereby lowering the risk borne by the financial institution, it is necessary to develop effective prediction models for prediction of the likelihood of bankruptcy and estimation of credit risk. A number of financial distress prediction models have been constructed, which utilize various machine learning techniques, such as single classifiers and classifier ensembles, but improving the prediction accuracy is the major research issue. In addition, aside from improving the prediction accuracy, there have been very few studies that specifically consider lowering the Type I error. In practice, Type I errors need to receive careful consideration during model construction because they can affect the cost to the financial institution. In this study, we introduce a classifier ensemble approach designed to reduce the misclassification cost. The outputs produced by multiple classifiers are combined by utilizing the unanimous voting (UV) method to find the final prediction result. Experimental results obtained based on four relevant datasets show that our UV ensemble approach outperforms the baseline single classifiers and classifier ensembles. Specifically, the UV ensemble not only provides relatively good prediction accuracy and minimizes Type I/II errors, but also produces the smallest misclassification cost.",Bankruptcy prediction | Classifier ensembles | Credit scoring | Financial distress prediction | Machine learning | Type I error,35,0,,,,undefined,

In this paper we develop the RatingBot: a text mining based rating approach, which efficiently and objectively models relevant qualitative information based on annual reports. It combines both the literature on text mining in finance and machine learning in credit rating to derive the credit rating of a company. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: a publicly available one that facilitates replicability, and a dataset provided by a major European bank representing real-world scenario.

In profit scoring systems, machine learning techniques has the potential to classify and regress. Here, we report the use of multivariate linear regression technique to predict the impact of profitability in p2p lending markets, using data collected from Lending Club where (152,167) p2p loans from 2008 to 2014 are examined in this study. We proposed to use Net Present Value(NPV) of each loan as a profitability measure. Before p2p lending used credit scoring systems to estimate the loan default probability, even though failed borrowers do not pay back the entire loan, certain amounts may be recovered. In addition, the loans that are risky have a high probability of default, and they have to pay high interest rates to finish the loss they can cause. Unlike previous studies that focused on probability of default in peer to peer lending, we focused on impacts that profitability of investing in p2p lending has using multivariate linear regression as a data mining technique and this study shows that some customers with a high probability of default may be profitable. This novel application of a linear regression, embedded in profit scoring systems could offer significant improvements in profitability in p2p lending markets.",Multivariate linear regression | Net Present Value. | Peer to peer | Profit based scoring,0,0,,,,undefined,

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a useful tool to assess the ability of a diagnostic test to discriminate among two classes or groups. In practice, multiple diagnostic tests or biomarkers may be combined to improve diagnostic accuracy, e.g. by maximizing the area under the ROC curve. In this paper we present Nonparametric Predictive Inference (NPI) for best linear combination of two biomarkers, where the dependence of the two biomarkers is modelled using parametric copulas. NPI is a frequentist statistical method that is explicitly aimed at using few modelling assumptions, enabled through the use of lower and upper probabilities to quantify uncertainty. The combination of NPI for the individual biomarkers, combined with a basic parametric copula to take dependence into account, has good robustness properties and leads to quite straightforward computation. We briefly comment on the results of a simulation study to investigate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the empirical method.

A literature study was conducted to determine current practices in the collections industry, as well as possible future innovations. A significant trend identified throughout the literature study was the increasing prioritisation of automated digital communication in several aspects of debt collection. It is reasonable to assume that this trend will continue to become the industry standard. Four recommendations are made based on the findings of the literature study. Firstly, South African collection agencies should investigate the feasibility of developing an app-based solution to performing collections. Secondly, collection agencies should supplement traditional modelling techniques with other tools, such as those developed in the field of machine learning. Thirdly, collection agencies could consider using speech analytics to obtain insights into call centre agents' performance and adherence to business rules. Lastly, the usage of social media data in collections as well as credit risk modelling in general is recommended as a topic for future study. Significance: A review of the various techniques currently employed in the field of debt collections may serve as useful reference for both academics and those working in debt collections.

At the same time business credit scoring still relies on financial data and is based on traditional methods. Such approaches, however, have the following limitations. First, financial reports are compiled typically once a year, hence scoring is infrequent. Second, since there is a delay of up to two years in publishing financial reports, scoring is based on outdated data and is not applied to young businesses. Third, quality of manually crafted models, although human-interpretable, is typically inferior to the ones constructed via machine learning.

Furthermore, we propose a new framework to evaluate the performance of credit ratings from multiple perspectives. The framework contains two components, defaulter recognition and rating quality. We use generic indices, area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and log loss, to evaluate the defaulter recognition ability of credit rating models. However, rating quality is more complicated than defaulter recognition. Inspired by rating agencies, we propose indices that reflect stability and migration of rating. We also adopt minimum default distance and rating path for evaluation of rating quality. Experimental results indicate that random forest (RF) has the best performance among the generic indices, but its stability is demonstrated to be 63% lower than the other two models.

In this paper, we attempt to study the effect of meta-cognition towards efficient feature representation in a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). To this end, we develop a Meta-cognitive Restricted Boltzmann Machine (McRBM) that decides what-to-represent, how-to-represent and when-to-represent for each sample in the training data set through its Sample deletion, Feature Representation and Sample Reserve strategies, respectively. The meta-cognitive component of McRBM helps to improve the generative training of RBM. The features thus generated by RBM are then used in classification through back propagation learning, which is derived based on the hinge-loss error function. The McRBM is used to solve credit scoring problem using the German credit data set, Australian credit data set and the KAGGLE credit data set.

SVM can solve the problem of classification and linear regression or nonlinear kernel which can be a learning algorithm for the ability of classification and regression. However, SVM also has a weakness that is difficult to determine the optimal parameter value. SVM calculates the best linear separator on the input feature space according to the training data. To classify data which are non-linearly separable, SVM uses kernel tricks to transform the data into a linearly separable data on a higher dimension feature space. The kernel trick using various kinds of kernel functions, such as : linear kernel, polynomial, radial base function (RBF) and sigmoid.

The 2 feature selection methods chi-square and principal component analysis were used for ranking and selecting the important features from the datasets. The classifiers were built on 5 training and test data partitions of the input data set. The performance of the hybrid algorithm was compared with that of the standalone classifiers: feature selection-based classifiers and bagging. The hybrid FS-HB algorithm performed best for qualitative dataset with less features and tree-based unstable base classifier. Its performance on numeric data was also better than other standalone classifiers, whereas comparable to bagging with only selected features. Its performance was found better on 70:30 data partition and the type II error, which is very significant in risk evaluation was also reduced significantly. The improved performance of FS-HB is attributed to the important features used for developing the classifier thereby reducing the complexity of the algorithm and the use of ensemble methodology, which added to the classical bias variance trade-off and performed better than standalone classifiers.",bagging | credit risk | ensemble | feature selection | hybrid methods,38,0,,,,undefined,

Such models are usually trained by using the past loan applications, evaluating the new ones on the basis of certain criteria. Although the state of the art offers several different approaches for their definition, this process represents a hard challenge due to several reasons. The most important ones are the data unbalance between the default and the non-default cases that reduces the effectiveness of almost all techniques, and the data heterogeneity, which makes it difficult the definition of a model able to effectively evaluate all the new loan applications. The approach proposed in this paper faces the aforementioned problems by moving the evaluation process from the canonical time domain to a frequency one, using a model based on the past non-default loan applications. It allows us to overcome the data unbalance problem by exploiting only a class of data, also defining a model that is less influenced by the data heterogeneity.

Seminal academic research has evaluated bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural networks). In this study, we test machine learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare their performance with results from discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985 to 2013 on North American firms, integrating information from the Salomon Center database and Compustat, analysing more than 10,000 firm-year observations. The key insight of the study is a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy using machine learning techniques especially when, in addition to the original Altman's Z-score variables, we include six complementary financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use new variables, such as the operating margin, change in return-on-equity, change in price-to-book, and growth measures related to assets, sales, and number of employees, as predictive variables. Machine learning models show, on average, approximately 10% more accuracy in relation to traditional models. Comparing the best models, with all predictive variables, the machine learning technique related to random forest led to 87% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis led to 69% and 50% accuracy, respectively, in the testing sample. We find that bagging, boosting, and random forest models outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included. Our research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques such as in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (2014) and Yeh, Chi, and Lin (2014). In particular, for machine learning mechanisms, we do not find SVM to lead to higher accuracy rates than other models. This result contradicts outcomes from Danenas and Garsva (2015) and Cleofas-Sanchez, Garcia, Marques, and Senchez (2016), but corroborates, for instance, Wang, Ma, and Yang (2014), Liang, Lu, Tsai, and Shih (2016), and Cano et al.

Instead of building a tree structure during the learning process, we propose merging nodes from different branches based on their similarity that is estimated with two-sample test statistics, which leads to generation of a deep directed acyclic graph of decision rules that can consist of hundreds of levels.

In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive boosted tree loan evaluation model by incorporating cost-sensitive learning and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to enhance the capability of discriminating potential default borrowers. Therefore, a portfolio allocation model that converts the portfolio optimization problem into an integer linear programming is proposed as a decision support system for unprofessional lenders. Unlike existing studies, which mainly evaluate the model through accuracy-based metrics, this study measures the expected profitability based on the annualized rate of return (ARR) and proposes a new metric (ARR curve) reflecting the ARR over different rejection rates. Two real-world P2P lending datasets are examined, and explanatory data analysis shows that explanatory variables differ in predicting the probability of default and profitability. Experimental results reveal that the area under the ARR curve is not a considerable metric in evaluating models from a profit perspective.

Recently, the significant theoretical advances in machine learning algorithms have pushed the application of kernel-based classifiers, producing very effective results. Unfortunately, such tools have an inability to provide an explanation, or comprehensible justification, for the solutions they supply. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to model credit scoring data, which exploits, indirectly, the classification power of the kernel machines into an operative field. A reconstruction process of the kernel classifier is performed via linear regression, if all predictors are numerical, or via a general linear model, if some or all predictors are categorical. The loss of performance, due to such approximation, is balanced by better interpretability for the end user, which is able to order, understand and to rank the influence of each category of the variables set in the prediction.

In Turkey, recent reports demonstrate that among different credit categories such as consumer, corporate, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) loans, SMEs reflect the highest NPL ratios. This paper focuses on SME credit behavioural scoring to develop an early NPL warning system after the credit is released. Utilizing application scoring features together with behavioural scoring features, an experimental study of classifying SME customers as non-performing or performing is targeted during lifetime of the credit. The proposed system aims to support a warning 6 months ahead to detect NPL state. Random Forest (RF) algorithm is implemented for NPL state classification of active SME credits. Accuracy results of RF algorithm is compared with different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees. It has been observed that accuracy of RF model is increased when different SME credit product features are added to the model.

Despite the huge number of inhabitants, these markets still lack a proper finance infrastructure. One of the main difficulties felt by customers is the access to loans. This limitation arises from the fact that most customers usually lack a verifiable credit history. As such, traditional banks are unable to provide loans. This paper proposes credit scoring modeling based on non-traditional data, acquired from smartphones, for loan classification processes. We use Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models which are the top performers in traditional banking. Then we compared the transformation of the training datasets creating boolean indicators against recoding using Weight of Evidence (WoE). Our models surpassed the performance of the manual loan application selection process, loans granted through the models criteria presented fewer overdues, also the approval criteria of the models increased the amount of granted loans substantially. Compared to the baseline, the loans approved by meeting the criteria of the SVM model presented −196.80% overdue rate. At the same time, the approval criteria of the SVM model generated 251.53% more loans. This paper shows that credit scoring can be useful in emerging markets.

Still, sentiment analysis in this domain has only been conducted with manual or dictionary based approaches until today. Since the manual approaches require human coders, which cause high labour costs, and dictionary based coding attains only mediocre results, we evaluate in how far machine learning based sentiment classification is able to attain superior performance measures. For this purpose, we identify and apply 216 combinations of textual feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and feature representation techniques as well as machine learning algorithms onto a manually classified corpus of 7071 texts from the microblogging platform Twitter, which are called Tweets. Results of McNemar's test indicate, that the Bag-of-Words technique for feature representation, dimensionality reduction including stemming, conversion to lower case letters and the removal of punctuation, numbers, URLs as well as stop words in combination with binary feature representation and a Support Vector Machine as a machine learning algorithm is most qualified. This combination attains significant higher evaluation figures than the remaining 215 combinations. Nevertheless, regression based machine learning is more robust towards pre-processing techniques than Support Vector Machines and might be more useful in practical applications despite its prolonged calculation time. The findings extend the current body of literature as they show how the quality of automated text analysis in the domain of corporate credit risk analysis can be improved. Researchers and practitioners can rely on the results in order to construct domain-specific sentiment classifiers. Researchers can further adopt the implemented classifiers, which are composed of various software libraries, and apply them in other scientific and practical domains.

Most approaches that use ensemble learning paradigms toward sentiment analysis involve feature engineering in order to enhance the predictive performance. In response, we sought to develop a paradigm of a multiobjective, optimization-based weighted voting scheme to assign appropriate weight values to classifiers and each output class based on the predictive performance of classification algorithms, all to enhance the predictive performance of sentiment classification. The proposed ensemble method is based on static classifier selection involving majority voting error and forward search, as well as a multiobjective differential evolution algorithm. Based on the static classifier selection scheme, our proposed ensemble method incorporates Bayesian logistic regression, naïve Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines as base learners, whose performance in terms of precision and recall values determines weight adjustment. Our experimental analysis of classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, software defect prediction, credit risk modeling, spam filtering, and semantic mapping, suggests that the proposed classification scheme can predict better than conventional ensemble learning methods such as AdaBoost, bagging, random subspace, and majority voting. Of all datasets examined, the laptop dataset showed the best classification accuracy (98.86%).",Ensemble learning | Multiobjective optimization | Sentiment analysis | Weighted majority voting,275,0,,,,undefined,

The importance of credit scoring has increased recently because of the financial crisis and increased capital requirements for banks. There are, however, only few studies that develop credit coring models for SME lending. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel, more accurate credit risk estimation approach for SMEs business lending. Based on traditional statistical methods and recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we proposed a hybrid model which combines the logistic regression approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). In order to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed hybrid model, we use the data of Finnish SMEs from the fiscal years 2004 to 2012. Our results suggest that the proposed ANN/logistic hybrid model is more accurate than either of the initial models ANN or logistic regression. This improvement in the accuracy of the credit scoring model decreases evaluation errors and has thereby many potential practical implications. First of all, a more accurate credit scoring model can result in better performance of the whole SME loan portfolio. Second, it can also result in lower capital requirements from the banks perspective and lower interest rates from the individual firm's perspective.

An example on consumer loans is presented, since management of retail exposures entails issues of everyday life being widely understood. Meanwhile the uncertainty on the risk that a Credit Institution bears when granting a loan to a customer with no prior performance history, is highlighted. Consequently, there is a variety of models that try to assess the probability of default of a loan, i.e. capital or interest not to be repaid. The model proposed in this study, has been trained with real historic data on clients' behavior and assets and can finally predict non-performing loans. A feedforward ANN has been created, which with simulation on unknown data for the network, managed to predict a quite satisfactory percentage, taking into consideration human parameters that influence these problems.

Classification algorithms are usually biased towards the majority class and can show deceivingly high overall prediction accuracy, while at the same time exhibiting poor performance in prediction of the minority class. Although altering class distribution can be an effective method for alleviating the adverse impact of class imbalance, limited research efforts have been devoted to empirical evaluation of the role of class distribution in credit risk assessment, especially when dealing with real life data samples.

Regarding this, researchers have developed complex credit scoring models using statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help banks and financial institutions to support their financial decisions. Various models, from easy to advanced approaches, have been developed in this domain. However, during the last few years there has been marked attention towards development of ensemble or multiple classifier systems, which have proved their ability to be more accurate than single classifier models. However, among the multiple classifier systems models developed in the literature, there has been little consideration given to: 1) combining classifiers of different algorithms (as most have focused on building classifiers of the same algorithm); or 2) exploring different classifier output combination techniques other than the traditional ones, such as majority voting and weighted average. In this paper, the aim is to present a new combination approach based on classifier consensus to combine multiple classifier systems (MCS) of different classification algorithms. Specifically, six of the main well-known base classifiers in this domain are used, namely, logistic regression (LR), neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT) and naïve Bayes (NB). Two benchmark classifiers are considered as a reference point for comparison with the proposed method and the other classifiers. These are used in combination with LR, which is still considered the industry-standard model for credit scoring models, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), a widely adopted technique in credit scoring studies. The experimental results, analysis and statistical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed combination method to improve prediction performance against all base classifiers, namely, LR, MARS and seven traditional combination methods, in terms of average accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), the H-measure and Brier score (BS).

The results further reveal that the prediction performance of the models declines around the threshold rating that is located between investment grade and speculative grade which is not necessarily the result of inadequacy of the models.

In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic designing of fuzzy rule-based classifiers (FRBCs) from financial data using multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms (MOEOAs). Our method generates, in a single experiment, an optimized collection of solutions (financial FRBCs) characterized by various levels of accuracy-interpretability trade-off. In our approach we address the complexity- and semantics-related interpretability issues, we introduce original genetic operators for the classifier's rule base processing, and we implement our ideas in the context of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), i.e., one of the presently most advanced MOEOAs. A significant part of the paper is devoted to an extensive comparative analysis of our approach and 24 alternative methods applied to three standard financial benchmark data sets, i.e., Statlog (Australian Credit Approval), Statlog (German Credit Approval), and Credit Approval (also referred to as Japanese Credit) sets available from the UCI repository of machine learning databases (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Several performance measures including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and some number of interpretability measures are employed in order to evaluate the obtained systems.

The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit.

From this viewpoint, loan applications evaluation is a classification task, in which the final decision can be either a crisp yes/no decision about the loan or a numeric score expressing the financial standing of the applicant. The knowledge to be used is inferred from data about past decisions. These data usually consist of both socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the applicant (e.g., age, income, and deposit), the characteristics of the loan, and the loan approval decision. A number of machine learning algorithms can be used for this purpose. In this paper we show how this task can be performed using the LISp-Miner system, a tool that is under development at the University of Economics, Prague. LISp-Miner is primarily focused on mining for various types of association rules, but unlike ""classical"" association rules proposed by Agrawal, LISp-Miner introduces a greater variety of different types of relations between the left-hand and right-hand sides of a rule. Two other procedures that can be used for classification task are implemented in LISp-Miner as well.

The linear discriminant analysis is one of the most common techniques used to define these models, although this simple parametric statistical method does not overcome some problems, the most important of which is the imbalanced distribution of data by classes. It happens since the number of default cases is much smaller than that of non-default ones, a scenario that reduces the effectiveness of the machine learning approaches, e.g., neural networks and random forests. The in Maximum Entropy (DME) approach proposed in this paper leads toward two interesting results: on the one hand, it evaluates the new loan applications in terms of maximum entropy difference between their features and those of the non-default past cases, using for the model training only these last cases, overcoming the imbalanced learning issue; on the other hand, it operates proactively, overcoming the cold-start problem.

A central problem for these P2P platforms is how to identify the most influential factors that are closely related to the credit risks. This problem is inherently complex due to the various forms of risks and the numerous influencing factors involved. Moreover, raw data of P2P lending are often high-dimension, highly correlated and unstable, making the problem more untractable by traditional statistical and machine learning approaches. To address these problems, we develop a novel filter-based feature selection method for P2P lending analysis. Unlike most traditional feature selection methods that use vectorial features, the proposed method is based on graphbased features and thus incorporates the relationships between pairwise feature samples into the feature selection process. Since the graph-based features are by nature completed weighted graphs, we use the steady state random walk to encapsulate the main characteristics of the graphbased features. Specifically, we compute a probability distribution of the walk visiting the vertices. Furthermore, we measure the discriminant power of each graph-based feature with respect to the target feature, through the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure between the probability distributions from the random walks. We select an optimal subset of features based on the most relevant graph-based features, through the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure. Unlike most existing state-of-theart feature selection methods, the proposed method can accommodate both continuous and discrete target features.

Many classification systems like image retrieval and credit scoring systems have imbalanced distribution of training data sets which causes performance degradation of the classifier. Re-sampling of imbalanced data is commonly used to handle imbalanced distribution as it is independent of the classifier being used. But sometimes they can remove necessary data of the class or can cause over-fitting. Classifier Ensembles have recently achieved more attention as effective technique to handle skewed data. The focus of the work is to gain advantages of both data level and classifier ensemble approach in order to improve the classification performance. We present a novel approach that initially applies pre-processing to the imbalanced dataset in order to reduce the imbalance between the classes. The pre-processed data is provided as training dataset to the classifier ensemble that introduces diversity by using different training datasets as well as different classifier models. The experimentation conducted on the eight imbalanced datasets from KEEL repository helps to prove the significance of the proposed method.

Several approaches have been proposed in this context in order to ensure the enhancement of the credit evaluation process by using various artificial intelligence approaches. Even if the proposed schemes have shown their efficiency, the provided decision regarding a credit is not correct in most cases due to the lack of information for a provided criteria, incorrect defined weights for credit criteria, and a missing information regarding a credit applicant. In this paper, we propose a hybrid neural network that ensures the enhancement of the decision for credit applicants data based on a credit scoring by considering the big data related to the context associated to credit criterion which is collected through a period of time. The proposed model ensures the evaluation of credit by using a set of collectors that are deployed through interconnected networks.

An empirical study is carried out to assess the performance of ten algorithms over six real-life bankruptcy and credit risk databases. The results reveal that the use of a unique performance measure often leads to contradictory conclusions, while the multiple-criteria decision-making techniques may yield a more reliable analysis.

Their credit scoring systems, if they exist, are strictly financial. Although many institutions consider the social and environmental impact of their loans, they do not incorporate formal systems to estimate these social and environmental impacts. This paper proposes that their creditworthiness evaluations should be coherent with their social mission and, accordingly, should estimate the social and environmental impact of microcredit. Thus, a decision support system to facilitate microcredit granting is proposed using a multicriteria evaluation. The assessment of social impact is performed by calculating the Social Net Present Value. The system captures credit officers' experience and addresses incomplete and intangible information. The model has been tested in a microfinance institution. The paper shows how a small institution can include social and environmental issues in its decision-making systems to evaluate credit applications. A gap in the preferences was found between members of the board, who are socially driven, and managers and credit officers, who are financially drifted. This mission drift was corrected. The approach followed contributed to creating a culture of social and environmental assessment within the institution, especially among credit officers, thereby translating Microfinance institutions' social mission into numbers.",Credit scoring | Decision support system | Microfinance | Multicriteria | Social and environmental impact | Social finance,44,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Banks assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers to lower a credit risk. Creditworthiness assessment is carried out by credit scoring methods. Most of these methods classify individuals into two categories: 'good' or 'bad' creditworthiness. Decision support system for loan granting based on these methods fail to differentiate the loan price for private borrowers. In practice, banks mostly grant loans applying decision support system that makes no price differentiation for individuals according to their private information. A bank may differentiate a loan price to attract a specific group of borrowers. In this paper, loan price differentiation impact on the behaviour of banks potential borrowers in the market for consumer lending is analyzed. A concept of a decision support system for loan granting based on the use of a continuous loan price function of the borrower's creditworthiness rating is proposed. Competition between banks using different loan price function of creditworthiness rating is analyzed. Borrowers with a low credit risk are interested in switching to a bank that reflects more private information in a loan price. Application of the proposed system provides a competitive advantage for a bank to attract borrowers with a low credit risk.

A historical review of the theoretical (or model) development of economic agents is presented together with significant works and future research directions. Some interesting conclusions are summarized from the literature review. (1) Credit theory studies can be categorized into traditional and emerging schools both focusing on the economic explanation of social credit in conjunction with creation and evolution mechanisms. (2) The most popular credit scoring methods include expert systems, econometric models, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, and their hybrid forms. Evaluation indexes should vary across different target agents.

The objective of this work is study the information gain, gain ratio and chi square correlation based feature selection method to reduce the feature dimensionality. Information gain measure identifies the entropy value of each specific feature. The amount of information gain or entropy is used to decide whether the feature is selected or deleted. Gain ratio applies normalization technique to information gain using spilt information value. The correlation based feature selection uses heuristic search strategies to estimate how the features are correlated with the class attribute and how they are important of each other.

Real world data classification tasks, as for example credit scoring applications have to deal with such data security limitations by finding a way to effectively incorporate privacy preserving procedures. To this end we propose as a first stage to use a microaggregation procedure in order to anonymize data over personal credit client feature information. In a second stage we examine the performance of support vector machines (SVM) on such anonymized data. SVM are powerful and robust machine learning methods, having superior credit scoring classification performance when applied to original, non-anonymized data. We first partition the original credit scoring data set and construct anonymized data representatives, which are then used for credit client behavior forecasting models constructed by SVM and other comparable learning methods. The validation procedure for such models is adapted to the two-stage modeling approach. In order to assess the loss owing to data anonymization, the different classification models are evaluated against models that are trained on the original data.",credit scoring | Data privacy | microaggregation | support vector machines,3,0,,,,undefined,

In this work we introduce an ensemble approach based on merged decision trees, the correlated-adjusted decision forest (CADF), to produce both accurate and comprehensible models. As main innovation, our proposal explores the combination of complementary sources of diversity as mechanisms to optimise model's structure, which leads to a manageable number of comprehensive decision rules without sacrificing performance. We evaluate our approach in comparison to individual classifiers and alternative ensemble strategies (gradient boosting, random forests).

Finding subgraphs capable of compressing data by abstracting instances of the substructures and identifying interesting patterns is thus crucial. When it comes to financial settings, data is very complex and in particular when risk factors relationships are not taken into account it seriously affects the goodness of predictions. In this paper, we posit that risk analysis can be leveraged if structure can be taken into account by discovering financial motifs in the input graphs.

Accurate and scientific credit assessment is of great significance to the operational decisions of shareholders, corporate creditors, and management. Building a good and reliable credit assessment model is key to credit assessment. Traditional credit assessment models are constructed using the support vector machine (SVM) combined with certain traditional dimensionality reduction algorithms. When constructing such a model, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are first applied to reduce the dimensions of the samples, so as to prevent the correlation of the samples' characteristic index from being too high. Then, machine learning of the samples will be conducted using the SVM, in order to carry out classification assessment. To further improve the accuracy of credit assessment methods, this paper has introduced more cutting-edge algorithms, applied isometric feature mapping (Isomap) for dimensionality reduction, and used the relevance vector machine (RVM) for credit classification. It has constructed an Isomap-RVM model and used it to conduct financial analysis of China's listed companies. The empirical analysis shows that the credit assessment accuracy of the Isomap-RVM model is significantly higher than that of the Isomap-SVM model and slightly higher than that of the PCA-RVM model.

Class 2 definitions redefine marginal probabilities from the joint probabilities. In fact, the marginal probabilities are given from the ensembles and should not be redefined from the joint probabilities. Both Class 1 and Class 2 definitions assume a joint distribution exists. Yet, they all ignore an important fact that the joint or the joint probability measure is not unique.

In this paper, an application of the locally linear model tree algorithm (LOLIMOT) was experimented to evaluate the superiority of its performance to predict the customer's credit status. The algorithm is improved with an aim of adjustment by credit scoring domain by means of data fusion and feature selection techniques.

Conventional credit rating approaches mainly concentrated on two-class classification (i.e. good or bad credit), which lacks adequate precision to perform credit risk evaluations in practice. In addition, most of previous researches directly focussed on employing various data mining techniques, but rare studies discussed the influence of data preprocessing before classifier construction. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This study considers nine-class classification (i.e. nine credit risk level) to credit rating prediction. For the development of more accurate classifiers, the paper adopts two-stage analysis, which integrates multiple data preprocessing and supervised learning techniques. Specifically, the first stage applies feature selection, data clustering, and data resampling methods to preprocess the data, and then the second stage utilizes several classification techniques and classifier ensembles to construct prediction models. Findings – The results show that Bagging-DT with data resampling method achieves excellent accuracy (82.96 percent), indicating that the proposed two-stage prediction model is better than conventional one-stage models. Originality/value – Practical implication of this study can lower credit rating expenses and also allow corporations to gain credit rating information instantly.",Decision making | Knowledge management,17,0,,,,undefined,

Corporate credit ratings involve various rating models, and their outputs can scale to multiple levels and be used for various applications. Such inherent complexity gives rise to the requirement of higher demands on the effectiveness of learning algorithms regarding the accuracy, overfitness, error distribution, and output distribution.

To adhere to customer classification, data mining models are used to find problematic households to precisely predict a high-risk group customer base. As a result, this precision provides a foundation for financial institutions to practice risk diversification and management. For customers without potential risk, such institutions can thus practice better deals, bonuses and diversified packages to increase customer loyalty.

For the AUC approach, the coefficients are estimated by calculating the AUC measure using theWilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Nelder-Mead algorithms. In a simulation study, we compare our new method to the logit model using different measures for predictive performance. The simulation study indicates the superiority of the AUC approach in cases where the logistic model assumption fails.

We find that the regression built using all the observations shows the highest area under the ROC curve and Kolmogorv–Smirnov statistics, while the regression that uses the least amount of observations shows the lowest performance and highest variance of these indicators. Nevertheless, the fourth selection algorithm presented shows almost the same performance as the base method using just 14 % of the dataset, and 14 less variables.

Banks often rely on information to screen loan applicants and to monitor borrowers. Making good use of information would positively impact banking sales, marketing and service functions. Opportunity areas for banks include decision support systems that help better understand risk, enhance sales and reduce service time. Loan assessment systems in state owned Egyptian banks have not proven efficiency in determining credit worthiness of the borrowers. This forced them to target other banks which resulted in negative effects on both customer acquisition and retention. Data mining techniques have proven efficiency and effectiveness in supporting risk management specifically credit risk; helping improving customer relationship management (CRM). In this research, we use data mining techniques to support credit risk management, taking into consideration CRM-related issues. The paper contributes an intelligent loan assessment framework that tackles the problem using classifying techniques to figure out attributes of defaulting borrowers' and clustering techniques to identify segments of importance to the bank, in order to design tailored financial services. The paper considers valuable factors, identified in the literature, which should be used in assessing loan applicants. The other factors used are based on interviews and data collected at the studied bank. The framework also includes an expert system which considers rules generated by the classification and clustering problems as well as other rules that can be used under several economic situations like inflation, recession or financial crisis to guide the decision. The proposed framework results in better loan assessment decisions and enhances CRM. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other study of the Egyptian public sector banks has investigated the use of such an intelligent loan assessment framework. The implementation was done using open source and public domain software.",Crm | Data mining | Expert systems | Intelligent systems | Loan assessment,0,0,,,,undefined,

In the prior literature, various classification techniques have been developed and studied, in/with which classifier ensembles by combining multiple classifiers approach have shown their outperformance over many single classifiers. However, in terms of constructing classifier ensembles, there are three critical issues which can affect their performance. The first one is the classification technique actually used/adopted, and the other two are the combination method to combine multiple classifiers and the number of classifiers to be combined, respectively. Since there are limited, relevant studies examining these aforementioned disuses, this paper conducts a comprehensive study of comparing classifier ensembles by three widely used classification techniques including multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees (DT) based on two well-known combination methods including bagging and boosting and different numbers of combined classifiers. Our experimental results by three public datasets show that DT ensembles composed of 80-100 classifiers using the boosting method perform best. The Wilcoxon signed ranked test also demonstrates that DT ensembles by boosting perform significantly different from the other classifier ensembles. Moreover, a further study over a real-world case by a Taiwan bankruptcy dataset was conducted, which also demonstrates the superiority of DT ensembles by boosting over the others.",Bankruptcy prediction | Classifier ensembles | Credit scoring | Data mining | Machine learning,130,0,,,,undefined,

This paper proposes a new classifier using immune principles and fuzzy rules to predict quality factors of individuals in banks. The proposed model is combined with fuzzy pattern classification to extract accurate fuzzy if-then rules.

However, in the real world, a substantial portion of the exposures is included in low-default portfolios (LDPs) in which the number of defaulted loans is usually much lower than the number of non-default observations. Modelling of these imbalanced data sets is particularly problematic with small portfolios in which the absence of information increases the specification error. Sovereigns, banks, or specialised retail exposures are recent examples of post-crisis portfolios with insufficient data for PD estimates, which require specific tools for risk quantification and validation. This paper explores the suitability of cooperative strategies for managing such scarce LDPs. In addition to the use of statistical and machine-learning classifiers, this paper explores the suitability of cooperative models and bootstrapping strategies for default prediction and multi-grade PD setting using two real-world credit consumer data sets. The performance is assessed in terms of out-of-sample and out-of-time discriminatory power, PD calibration, and stability. The results indicate that combinational approaches based on correlation-adjusted strategies are promising techniques for managing sparse LDPs and providing accurate and well-calibrated credit risk estimates. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Improving the accuracy of classification by even a fraction of one percent translates into significant future savings for the credit companies and increased efficiency when supporting more efficient use of economic capital by enterprise administrators. To increase the accuracy of classification and develop an efficient classifier, this work presents a hybrid artificial immune algorithm and multilayer perceptron (AIA-MLP) classifier. The optimization of weights in the network topology of the MLP classifier can be considered as an unconstrained global optimization problem in which an energy function is minimized. Therefore, weights in the network topology of the MLP classifier can be optimized efficiently using the AIA approach, which is a stochastic global optimization method. The performance of the proposed AIA-MLP classifier is evaluated by using a real-world dataset of Australian credit approvals, which was taken from the UCI repository of machine learning databases. This work compares experimental results concerning the AIA-MLP classifier with those concerning many support vector machine (SVM) and an MIMO cerebellar model articulation controller neural network (CMAC NN) classifiers. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of classification of the AIA-MLP classifier is superior to those of many SVM and the MIMO CMAC NN classifiers. © 2014 ISSN 1881-803X.",Artificial immune algorithm | Classification | Credit risk evaluation | Credit scoring | Multilayer perceptron,0,0,,,,undefined,

In this preliminary restriction, fast algorithms for feature ranking and earlier experience are used. Additionally, enhancements are made in the creation of the initial population, as well as by introducing an incremental stage in the genetic algorithm. The performances of the proposed HGA-NN classifier are evaluated using a real-world credit dataset that is collected at a Croatian bank, and the findings are further validated on another real-world credit dataset that is selected in a UCI database.

Incorrect decision-making in financial institutions is very likely to cause financial crises and distress. Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are two important problems facing financial decision support. As many related studies develop financial distress models by some machine learning techniques, more advanced machine learning techniques, such as classifier ensembles and hybrid classifiers, have not been fully assessed. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel hybrid financial distress model based on combining the clustering technique and classifier ensembles. In addition, single baseline classifiers, hybrid classifiers, and classifier ensembles are developed for comparisons. In particular, two clustering techniques, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and k-means and three classification techniques, logistic regression, multilayer-perceptron (MLP) neural network, and decision trees, are used to develop these four different types of bankruptcy prediction models. As a result, 21 different models are compared in terms of average prediction accuracy and Type I & II errors. By using five related datasets, combining Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) with MLP classifier ensembles performs the best, which provides higher predication accuracy and lower Type I & II errors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This model obtains credit risk information, such as default probability, from the market prices of bonds. The model simultaneously estimates implied default probability and recovery rate through comparison of the price fluctuation structure of issues. The market value of properties poses a problem since, as a general rule, real estate has low liquidity and transaction prices are not published. However, because investment corporations that issue investment corporation bonds proactively disclose information (property acquisition prices, NOI, etc.) about owned properties that serve as collateral assets, we can estimate the recovery rate from this information. Then, from market price data for investment corporation bonds, we can obtain new information, including the term structure of default probability for each bond rating and the validity of the pricing model. © 2013 IEEE.",Corporate bond pricing model | Credit risk | Default probability | Investment corporation bonds | J-REIT | Recovery rate,0,0,,,,undefined,

Most research on machine learning assumes that the attributes of training and tests instances are not only completely specified but are also free from noise. Real world data, however, often suffer from corruptions or noise but not always known. This is the heart of information-based credit risk models. However, blindly applying such machine learning techniques to noisy financial credit risk evaluation data may fail to make very good or perfect predictions. Unfortunately, despite extensive research over the last decades, the impact of poor quality of data (especially noise) on the accuracy of credit risk has attracted less attention, even though it remains a significant problem for many. This paper investigates the robustness of five machine learning (supervised) algorithms to noisy credit risk environment. In particular, we show that when noise is added to four real-world credit risk domains, a significant and disproportionate number of total errors are contributed by class noise compared to attribute noise; thus, in the presence of noise, it is noise on the class variable that are responsible for the poor predictive accuracy of the learning concept. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.",Classifiers | Credit risk | Machine learning | Noisy data | Predictive accuracy,10,0,,,,undefined,

However, most approaches cannot perform well in all the three aspects simultaneously. The objective of this study is to put forward a classification approach named C-TOPSIS that can balance the three aspects well. C-TOPSIS is based on the rationale of TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). TOPSIS is famous for reliable evaluation results and quick computing process and it is easy to understand and use. However, it is a ranking approach and three challenges have to be faced for modifying TOPSIS into a classification approach. C-TOPSIS works out three strategies to overcome the challenges and retains the advantages of TOPSIS. So C-TOPSIS is deduced to have reliable classification results, high computational efficiency and ease of use and understanding. Our findings in the experiment verify the advantages of C-TOPSIS. In comparison with 7 popular approaches on 2 widely used UCI credit datasets, C-TOPSIS ranks 2nd in accuracy, 1st in complexity and is in 1st rank in interpretability. Only C-TOPSIS ranks among the top 3 in all the three aspects, which verifies that C-TOPSIS can balance accuracy, complexity and interpretability well. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, credit scoring in the microfinance industry is a relatively recent application, and current research is based, to the best of our knowledge, on classical statistical methods. This lack is surprising since the implementation of credit scoring based on supervised classification algorithms should contribute towards the efficiency of microfinance institutions, thereby improving their competitiveness in an increasingly constrained environment. This paper explores an extensive list of Statistical Learning techniques as microfinance credit scoring tools from an empirical viewpoint. A data set of microcredits belonging to a Peruvian Microfinance Institution is considered, and the following models are applied to decide between default and non-default credits: linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machines, classification trees, and ensemble methods based on bagging and boosting algorithm. The obtained results suggest the use of a multilayer perceptron trained in the R statistical system with a second order algorithm.

Since a probability is an expected value, all nonparametric regression approaches which are consistent for the mean are consistent for the probability estimation problem. Among others, random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and bagged k-nearest neighbors (bNN) belong to this class of consistent nonparametric regression approaches.

Client profiles are evaluated, being their results expressed in terms of an ordinal score scale (Excelent Good Fair Poor). Intelligent systems have then to take in consideration different criteria such as payment history, mortgages, wages among others in order to commit their outcome. To achieve this goal, researchers have been delving models capable to render these multiple criteria encompassed on ordinal data. The literature presents a myriad of different methods either on OR or AI fields for the multi-criteria models.

Although there are many studies regarding decision-making problems, such as credit policy decisions through bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring, there is no research, to our knowledge, about dividend prediction or dividend policy forecasting using machine learning approaches in spite of the significance of dividends. For dealing with the problems involved in literature, we suggest a knowledge refinement model that can refine the multiple rules extracted through rule-based algorithms from dividend data sets by utilizing genetic algorithm (GA). The new technique, called ""GAKR (genetic algorithm knowledge refinement)"", aims to combine the advantages of both knowledge consolidation and GA. The main result of the cross-validation procedure is the average accuracy rate of prediction in the five sets over the five iterations. The experiments show that GAKR model always outperforms other models in the performance of dividend policy prediction; we can predict future dividend policy more correctly than any other models. The major advantages of GAKR model can be summarized as follows: (1) Classification process of GAKR can be very fast with a compact set of rules. In other words, fast training mechanism of GAKR is possible regardless of data set sizes. (2) Multiple rules extracted by GAKR development process are much simpler and easier to understand.

This strategy enables them to manage their financial and operational risks within the pool of financial institutes. Machine learning algorithms especially binary classifiers are very popular for that purpose. In real-life applications such as CRA, feature selection algorithms are used to decrease data acquisition cost and to increase interpretability of the decision process. Using feature selection methods directly on CRA data sets may not help due to categorical variables such as marital status. Such features are usually are converted into binary features using 1-of-k encoding and eliminating a subset of features from a group does not help in terms of data collection cost or interpretability. In this study, we propose to use the probit classifier with a proper prior structure and multiple kernel learning with a proper kernel construction procedure to perform group-wise feature selection (i.e., eliminating a group of features together if they are not helpful). Experiments on two standard CRA data sets show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed binary classification algorithm variants. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",classification | discrimination | fairness | information theory | logistic regression | social responsibility,373,1,repositoryam,Green,JSPS,24500194,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

However, the performance of DT based credit scoring model is often relatively poorer than other techniques. This is mainly due to two reasons: DT is easily affected by (1) the noise data and (2) the redundant attributes of data under the circumstance of credit scoring. In this study, we propose two dual strategy ensemble trees: RS-Bagging DT and Bagging-RS DT, which are based on two ensemble strategies: bagging and random subspace, to reduce the influences of the noise data and the redundant attributes of data and to get the relatively higher classification accuracy. Two real world credit datasets are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed methods. Experimental results reveal that single DT gets the lowest average accuracy among five single classifiers, i.e., Logistic Regression Analysis (LRA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN). Moreover, RS-Bagging DT and Bagging-RS DT get the better results than five single classifiers and four popular ensemble classifiers, i.e., Bagging DT, Random Subspace DT, Random Forest and Rotation Forest. The results show that RS-Bagging DT and Bagging-RS DT can be used as alternative techniques for credit scoring. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

SVMs reduce most machine learning problems to optimization problems and optimization lies at the heart of SVMs. Lots of SVM algorithms involve solving not only convex problems, such as linear programming, quadratic programming, second order cone programming, semi-definite programming, but also non-convex and more general optimization problems, such as integer programming, semi-infinite programming, bi-level programming and so on. The purpose of this paper is to understand SVM from the optimization point of view, review several representative optimization models in SVMs, their applications in economics, in order to promote the research interests in both optimization-based SVMs theory and economics applications. This paper starts with summarizing and explaining the nature of SVMs. It then proceeds to discuss optimization models for SVM following three major themes. First, least squares SVM, twin SVM, AUC Maximizing SVM, and fuzzy SVM are discussed for standard problems. Second, support vector ordinal machine, semisupervised SVM, Universum SVM, robust SVM, knowledge based SVM and multi-instance SVM are then presented for nonstandard problems. Third, we explore other important issues such as lp-norm SVM for feature selection, LOOSVM based on minimizing LOO error bound, probabilistic outputs for SVM, and rule extraction from SVM. At last, several applications of SVMs to financial forecasting, bankruptcy prediction, credit risk analysis are introduced. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.",bankruptcy prediction | credit risk analysis | data mining (DM) | financial forecasting | machine learning (ML) | optimization | support vector machines (SVMs),116,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,NSFC,71110107026,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The hybrid model simultaneously optimizes the SVM kernel function parameters and the input feature subset in order to achieve a high accuracy.

In doing so, we employ the basic forms of structural (the Merton model) and reduced-form (constant intensity) models in a cross-sectional and a time series setup. By utilizing a credit default swap dataset exclusively for estimation and out-of-sample prediction, our study also serves as a comparison between the basic forms of credit risk models. Finally, it contrasts the results with the performance of a new supervised learning forecasting technique, the Support Vector Machines Regression. We show that although the Merton and the constant intensity models handle default timing and interest rates differently, the prediction performance in cross-sectional and time series analyses is, on average, similar.

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be socially and legally fair from a viewpoint of social responsibility; namely, it must be unbiased and nondiscriminatory in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. From a privacy-preserving viewpoint, this can be interpreted as hiding sensitive information when classification results are observed. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2011 IEEE.",Classification | Discrimination | Fairness | Information theory | Logistic regression | Privacy,219,0,repositoryvor,Green,JSPS,22500142,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

Fortunately, financial institutions count with external vendors databases that indicate the level of recognition of their customers. However, this information is normally presented as features with partial scores that must be aggregated into an overall matching accuracy score. This score indicates how similar a record is to a master database that contains the best available public information about a specific customer. In addition, information management and risk management departments of financial institutions may have very different models. Hence, it is necessary to connect the customer recognition information with risk models. This paper studies this problem in two parts: (1) generation of a matching accuracy score to quantify the status of entity resolution between consumer records of a major financial company and an external database, and (2) evaluation of the relationship between the matching accuracy score and several risk segments. As a final result, an overall matching accuracy score is obtained for every customer using the most current account information and a learning algorithm. The matching accuracy score is an indicator of the level of customer recognition. This matching accuracy score is correlated with the FICO score (FICO is a risk score generated by the company Fair Isaac Co. The maximum value of FICO is 850.

Credit requests, of new and existing customers, are often evaluated by classical discrimination rules based on customers information. However, these kinds of strategies have serious limits and don't take into account the characteristics difference between current customers and the future ones. The aim of this paper is to measure credit worthiness for non customers borrowers and to model potential risk given a heterogeneous population formed by borrowers customers of the bank and others who are not. We hold on previous works done in generalized discrimination and transpose them into the logistic model to bring out efficient discrimination rules for non customers' subpopulation. Therefore we obtain seven simple models of connection between parameters of both logistic models associated respectively to the two subpopulations. The German credit data set is selected as the experimental data to compare the seven models. Experimental results show that the use of links between the two subpopulations improve the classification accuracy for the new loan applicants. © 2011 IEEE.",Credit scoring | Gaussian discrimination | Logistic model | Subpopulation links | Subpopulations mixture,0,0,,,,undefined,

We address this issue in the context of credit card screening, where it is important to not only find a neural network with good predictive performance but also one that facilitates a clear explanation of how it produces its predictions. We show that minimal neural networks with as few as one hidden unit provide good predictive accuracy, while having the added advantage of making it easier to generate concise and comprehensible classification rules for the user. To further reduce model size, a novel approach is suggested in which network connections from the input units to this hidden unit are removed by a very straightaway pruning procedure. In terms of predictive accuracy, both the minimized neural networks and the rule sets generated from them are shown to compare favorably with other neural network based classifiers. The rules generated from the minimized neural networks are concise and thus easier to validate in a real-life setting. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.",credit scoring | Pruning | rule extraction,36,0,,,,undefined,

This algorithm is especially efficient when few patterns of a class are available, or when information inherent to low probability events is crucial for a successful application, as weight updating is overemphasized in the less frequent activations than in the more frequent ones.

Currently emerging data mining and machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM), have been discussed widely in credit risk evaluation. In this paper a new kernel-based learning method called kernel affine subspace nearest point (KASNP) approach is proposed for credit risk evaluation. KASNP approach is derived from the nearest point problem of SVM, which extends the areas searched for the nearest points from the convex hulls in SVM to affine subspaces. Similar to SVM, KASNP can also classify the typical nonlinear two-spiral problem well. But unlike SVM to solve the difficult convex quadratic programming problem, KASNP is an unconstrained optimal problem whose solution can be directly computed. We apply KASNP for credit evaluation, and the experiments on three credit datasets show that the proposed KASNP is more competitive for creditors classification. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Non repayment of such credits cause many problems to the banks such as incapability to repay the central bank's loans, increasing the amount of credit allocations comparing to credit repayment and incapability to allocate more credits to customers. The importance of credit allocation in banking industry and it's important role in economic growth and employment creation leads the development of many models to evaluate the credit risk of applicants. But many of these models are classic and are incapable to do credit evaluation completely and efficiently. Therefore the demand to use artificial intelligence in this field has grown up.

Banks must evaluate credit risk of credit applicants by using standardized (external rating institutions) or internal ratings-based (IRB) methods. Banks which decided to use IRB method attempt to develop precise internal credit rating models for the evaluation of creditworthiness of their borrowers. The internal rating method for the estimation of default probability requires to collect the default information from the historical data in banks. The major studies about default determinating factors are based on classification methods (Zhou, Xie, Yuan, 2008). A classification model considers the default measurement as the pattern recognition where all borrowers are divided to non-default and default groups based on their financial and non financial data. Banks attempt to construct an evaluation model that can be used to discriminate new sample. This research focuses on a credit rating model development which could attribute credit ratings for Lithuanian companies. The steps of a model's development and improvement process are described in this paper. The model's development begins with the selection of initial variables (financial ratios) characterizing default and non-default companies. 20 financial ratios of 5 years were calculated according to annual financial reports. Then statistical and artificial intelligence methods were selected for the classification of companies into two groups: default and non-default. A discriminant analysis, logistic regression and artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron) were applied for this purpose. Often statistical methods are not able to operate with a large amount of data, so the analysis of variance, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and factor analysis were applied for data reduction. Artificial neural networks often are able to analyze a large amount of data so variable selection was accomplished by the network itself calculating ranks of importance for every initial variable. There were constructed 15 classification models and their classification accuracy was measured by calculating correct classification rates. The most accurate was a logistic regression model analyzing data of 3 years (97% of correctly classified companies). Then the sample of companies was supplemented with new data and changes in classification accuracy were estimated. The significant decrease of classification accuracy conditioned the need of model update. For this reason the logistic regression coefficients were recalculated. In order to classify non-default companies into 7 classes: profitability, liquidity, financial structure and individual possibility of default estimated by a logistic regression model were determined as rating criterions. Then the rating scale was constructed and credit ratings were attributed for companies in the sample. The calculated probabilities of default indicated that some lower ratings have lower probabilities of default. These imperfections were corrected by the modification of a rating scale. The research has shown that the developed model is a valid tool for the estimation of credit risk.",Bank | Classification methods | Credit ratings | Credit risk,15,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

The question is answered by comparing the performance of a variety of one-class and two-class classifiers on a selection of credit scoring datasets as the class imbalance is manipulated. We also include random oversampling as this is one of the most common approaches to addressing class imbalance. This study analyses the suitability and performance of recognised two-class classifiers and one-class classifiers. Based on our study we conclude that the performance of the two-class classifiers deteriorates proportionally to the level of class imbalance. The two-class classifiers outperform one-class classifiers with class imbalance levels down as far as 15% (i.e. the imbalance ratio of minority class to majority class is 15:85). The one-class classifiers, whose performance remains unvaried throughout, are preferred when the minority class constitutes approximately 2% or less of the data. Between an imbalance of 2% to 15% the results are not as conclusive. These results show that one-class classifiers could potentially be used as a solution to the low-default portfolio problem experienced in the credit scoring domain. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,18,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Discrimination in credit, mortgage, insurance, labor market, and education has been investigated by researchers in economics and human sciences. With the advent of automatic decision support systems, such as credit scoring systems, the ease of data collection opens several challenges to data analysts for the fight against discrimination. In this article, we introduce the problem of discovering discrimination through data mining in a dataset of historical decision records, taken by humans or by automatic systems. We formalize the processes of direct and indirect discrimination discovery by modelling protected-by-law groups and contexts where discrimination occurs in a classification rule based syntax. Basically, classification rules extracted from the dataset allow for unveiling contexts of unlawful discrimination, where the degree of burden over protected-by-law groups is formalized by an extension of the lift measure of a classification rule. In direct discrimination, the extracted rules can be directly mined in search of discriminatory contexts. In indirect discrimination, the mining process needs some background knowledge as a further input, for example, census data, that combined with the extracted rules might allow for unveiling contexts of discriminatory decisions. A strategy adopted for combining extracted classification rules with background knowledge is called an inference model. In this article, we propose two inference models and provide automatic procedures for their implementation.

One of the most active areas of recent research in ML has been the use of ensemble (combining) classifiers. Research indicates that ensemble individual classifiers lead to a significant improvement in classification performance by having them vote for the most popular class. This paper explores the predicted behaviour of five classifiers for different types of noise in terms of credit risk prediction accuracy, and how such accuracy could be improved by using classifier ensembles. Benchmarking results on four credit datasets and comparison with the performance of each individual classifier on predictive accuracy at various attribute noise levels are presented. The experimental evaluation shows that the ensemble of classifiers technique has the potential to improve prediction accuracy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the second stage, different SVM learning paradigms with much dissimilarity are constructed as intelligent agents for credit risk evaluation. In the third stage, multiple individual SVM agents are trained using training subsets and the corresponding evaluation results are also obtained. In the final stage, all individual results produced by multiple SVM agents in the previous stage are aggregated into an ensemble result.

Recently, a more pragmatic approach has been adopted, where the first issue is credit risk prediction, instead of explanation. In this context, several classification techniques have been shown to perform well on credit scoring, such as support vector machines among others. While the investigation of better classifiers is an important research topic, the specific methodology chosen in real world applications has to deal with the challenges arising from the real world data collected in the industry. Such data are often highly unbalanced, part of the information can be missing and some common hypotheses, such as the i.i.d. one, can be violated. In this paper we present a case study based on a sample of IBM Italian customers, which presents all the challenges mentioned above. The main objective is to build and validate robust models, able to handle missing information, class unbalancedness and non-iid data points. We define a missing data imputation method and propose the use of an ensemble classification technique, subagging, particularly suitable for highly unbalanced data, such as credit scoring data. Both the imputation and subagging steps are embedded in a customized cross-validation loop, which handles dependencies between different credit requests. The methodology has been applied using several classifiers (kernel support vector machines, nearest neighbors, decision trees, Adaboost) and their subagged versions. The use of subagging improves the performance of the base classifier and we will show that subagging decision trees achieve better performance, still keeping the model simple and reasonably interpretable. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A novel credit-scoring model, called vertical bagging decision trees model (abbreviated to VBDTM), is proposed for the purpose in this paper. The model is a new bagging method that is different from the traditional bagging. The VBDTM model gets an aggregation of classifiers by means of the combination of predictive attributes. In the VBDTM model, all train samples and just parts of attributes take part in learning of every classifier. By contrast, classifiers are trained with the sample subsets in the traditional bagging method and every classifier has the same attributes. The VBDTM has been tested by two credit databases from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the analysis results show that the performance of the method proposed by us is outstanding on the prediction accuracy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, however, we propose an active learning approach, in which a model is built with the interaction of humans. Specifically, our model consists of two sub-models which predict a debtor's DP from different mathematical aspects. Additionally, our model actively selects an unlabeled instance for humans to label (i.e. give its DP) according to its information density as well as the disagreement of the two sub-models on its label. We also develop a special method to measure the information density of an unlabeled instance.

One of the key outputs of an internal rating system is the probability of default (PD), which reflects the likelihood that a counterparty will default on his/her financial obligation. Since the PD modelling problem basically boils down to a discrimination problem (defaulter or not), one may rely on the myriad of classification techniques that have been suggested in the literature. However, since the credit risk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation, they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines are less suitable due to their black box nature. Building upon previous research, we will use AntMiner to build internal rating systems for credit risk. AntMiner allows to infer a propositional rule set from a given data set, hereby using the principles from Ant Colony Optimization. Experiments will be conducted using various types of credit data sets (retail, small- and medium-sized enterprises and banks). It will be shown that the extracted rule sets are both powerful in terms of discriminatory power and comprehensibility.

The main purpose of credit risk estimation in banks is the determination of company's ability to fulfil its financial obligations in future. It is very important to have a proper instrument for the estimation of credit risk in banks because it reduces potential loss due to crediting reliable clients. Banks develop internal credit risk estimation models and various data analysis methods can be applied for this purpose. Statistical predictive analytic techniques and artificial intelligence can be used to determine default risk levels. Banks must also have data about clients from the activity in the past. To understand risk levels of credits, banks usually collect information about borrowers. Financial ratios remain primary variables for predicting corporate financial distress. The principal financial ratios as variables for the analysis are indicators of company's financial structure, solvency, profitability and cash flow. Credit risk estimation models are based on the analysis of this data. Using these models it becomes possible to predict the default possibility of new clients. Credit risk estimation models in banks differ significantly in architecture and operating design. The main reason for these differences is that banks' models are assigned by bank personnel and are usually not revealed to outsiders. The object of this research is credit risk estimation models. The purpose of research is to develop credit risk estimation models and to evaluate an influence of input data reduction on credit risk models accuracy. Two methods were applied in this research: the analysis of scientific publications about estimation of credit risk and the analysis of developed in this research credit risk estimation models performance. Analyzing financial data of Lithuanaian companies three initial credit risk estimation models were developed wherein these data analysis methods were applied: discriminant analysis (DA), logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) - multilayer perceptron. 60 financial rates of companies were analyzed. They were calculated from the financial reports of Lithuanian companies for 3 years. The variable selection for the DA model was accomplished applying the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The variable selection for the LR model was accomplished applying ANOVA. The actual variables for credit risk analysis in ANN model were selected by network according to their ranks of importance. The classification accuracy of models was evaluated by the correct classification rate (CCR). The highest classification accuracy was reached by LR model, which classified 97% of companies correctly. ANN model correctly classified 95.5%, DA model - 84% of companies. Further situation was analyzed where 60 initial variables were reduced applying factor analysis and the changes in classification accuracy of models were estimated. The number of factors to retain were calculated by the Kaiser criterion ant the scree test. After the factor analysis the 6 new credit risk estimation models were developed applying the same data analysis methods: DA, LR and ANN. By every method 15 and 6 new variables obtained from the factor analysis were analyzed. The research has shown that the new 15 variables extract 89.37% of variance from initial variables. Analyzing these variables, the percent of correctly classified companies mostly decreased in ANN model (-14.6%). The classification accuracy of other models decreased from 2.0% to 7.1%. If an analyst includes into credit risk estimation only 6 new variables, which extract 63.92% of variance from initial variables, the highest decrease in classification accuracy will also be in ANN model (-15.7%).",Artificial neural networks | Credit risk | Discriminant analysis | Factor analysis | Logistic regression,8,0,,,,undefined,

However credit scoring methods are prone to error. Failures from credit scoring result in granting loans to high risk customers, thus significantly increasing the incidence of overdue payments, or in the worst case, customers defaulting on the loan altogether. In this research the authors use a machine learning approach to improve the identification of such customers. However, identifying such bad customers is not a trivial task as they form the minority of customers and standard machine learning algorithms have difficulty in learning accurate models on such imbalanced datasets. They propose a novel approach based on a data segmentation strategy that progressively partitions the original data set into segments where bad customers form the majority. These segments, known as Majority Bad Payment Segments (MBPS) are then used to train machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, C4.5, and Bayesian Network to identify high risk customers in advance. The authors compare their approach to the traditional approach of under sampling the majority class of good customers using a variety of metrics such as Hit Rate, Coverage and the Area under the Curve (AUC) metrics which have been designed to evaluate classification performance on imbalanced data sets. The results of our experimentation showed that the MBPS generally outperformed the under sampling method on all of these measures. Although MBPS has been used in this research in the context of a financial credit application, the technique is a generic one and can be used in any application domain that involves imbalanced data. © 2010, IGI Global.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

In the L-GEM, an upper bound of generalization error of unseen samples within a Q-neighborhood of training samples is provided. The L-GEM has been widely adopted in many application areas, e.g. image classification, corporate credit risk prediction and construction productivity enhancement in civil engineering.

Unfortunately, the non-linear nature of the widely accepted Black-Scholes option price model, which sits at the very heart of the structural credit risk model, causes great difficulty when inferring the latent asset value sequence from observed data. The main contribution of this paper is to address this problem by pursuing maximum likelihood state estimation (MLE) instead of the usual particle filtering approach. Experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed MLE approach: it achieves a much lower inference error and a much lower running time than particle filtering methods.

This can be treated as a kind of machine learning (ML) problem. Recently, the use of ML algorithms has proven to be of great practical value in solving a variety of risk problems including credit risk prediction. One of the most active areas of recent research in ML has been the use of ensemble (combining) classifiers. Research indicates that ensemble individual classifiers lead to a significant improvement in classification performance by having them vote for the most popular class. This paper explores the predicted behaviour of five classifiers for different types of noise in terms of credit risk prediction accuracy, and how could such accuracy be improved by using pairs of classifier ensembles. Benchmarking results on five credit datasets and comparison with the performance of each individual classifier on predictive accuracy at various attribute noise levels are presented. The experimental evaluation shows that the ensemble of classifiers technique has the potential to improve prediction accuracy. © Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag 2009.",Credit risk | Ensemble | Prediction | Statistical pattern recognition | Supervised learning,8,0,,,,undefined,

Such models ought to be as accurate as possible. One important step towards the development of accurate financial classification models involves the selection of the appropriate independent variables (features) which are relevant for the problem at hand. This is known as the feature selection problem in the machine learning/data mining field. In financial decisions, feature selection is often based on the subjective judgment of the experts. Nevertheless, automated feature selection algorithms could be of great help to the decision-makers providing the means to explore efficiently the solution space. This study uses two nature-inspired methods, namely ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization, for this problem.

In this proposed model, some artificial intelligent techniques, which are used as intelligent agents, are first used to analyze and evaluate the risk levels of credit applicants over a set of pre-defined criteria. Then these evaluation results, generated by different intelligent agents, are fuzzified into some fuzzy opinions on credit risk level of applicants. Finally, these fuzzification opinions are aggregated into a group consensus and meantime the fuzzy aggregated consensus is defuzzified into a crisp aggregated value to support final decision for decision-makers of credit-granting institutions.

The five techniques perform well in predicting default particularly one year before financial distress. Furthermore, the prediction still remains sound even 5 years before default. No single methodology has the absolute best classification ability, as the model performance varies in terms of different time periods and variable groups.

For dealing with the above issues, we suggest a knowledge refinement model that can refine the multiple rules extracted through rule-based algorithms from dividend data sets using GA. The new technique, called 'GAKR (genetic algorithm knowledge refinement)', aims to combine the advantages of both knowledge consolidation and genetic algorithm. The experiments show that GAKR model always outperforms other models in the performance of dividend policy forecasting; we can predict future dividend policy more correctly than any other models.

This paper proposes a relatively transparent credit scoring model for evaluating the creditworthiness of the credit applicants through a hybrid data mining approach. The main motivation to apply this approach is to obtain a credit scoring model from a data set that not only have the required performance, but it is relatively interpretable. This objective is achieved through three steps and using complementary soft computing methods. In the first step, the fuzzy system is automatically generated from the data using a fuzzy clustering method. A genetic algorithm is used to increase the performance of the initial fuzzy inference system in the second phase. In the last phase a multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to achieve two goals: to preserve the accuracy of the fuzzy model to a given value and to enhance the interpretability of the fuzzy model by reducing the fuzzy sets in the rule base.

However, the performance of SVMs is not fully understood in the literature because an insufficient number of data sets is considered and different kernel functions are used to train the SVMs. In this paper, four public data sets are used. In particular, three different sizes of training and testing data in each of the four data sets are considered (i.e. 3:7, 1:1 and 7:3) in order to examine and fully understand the performance of SVMs. For SVM model construction, the linear, radial basis function and polynomial kernel functions are used to construct the SVMs. Using MLP as the benchmark, the SVM classifier only performs better in one of the four data sets.

The base models are trained on different sets of reduced client characteristics and may also use different kernels. Furthermore, using censored outputs of multiple SVM models leads to more reliable predictions in most cases. But there also remains a credit client subset that seems to be unpredictable.

Traditionally, logistic regression and discriminant analysis are the most widely used approaches to create scoring models in the industry. However, these methods are associated with quite a few limitations, such as being instable with high-dimensional data and small sample size, intensive variable selection effort and incapability of efficiently handling non-linear features. Most importantly, based on these algorithms, it is difficult to automate the modelling process and when population changes occur, the static models usually fail to adapt and may need to be rebuilt from scratch. In the last few years, the kernel learning approach has been investigated to solve these problems. However, the existing applications of this type of methods (in particular the SVM) in credit scoring have all focused on the batch model and did not address the important problem of how to update the scoring model on-line. This paper presents a novel and practical adaptive scoring system based on an incremental kernel method. With this approach, the scoring model is adjusted according to an on-line update procedure that can always converge to the optimal solution without information loss or running into numerical difficulties. Non-linear features in the data are automatically included in the model through a kernel transformation. This approach does not require any variable reduction effort and is also robust for scoring data with a large number of attributes and highly unbalanced class distributions. Moreover, a new potential kernel function is introduced to further improve the predictive performance of the scoring model and a kernel attribute ranking technique is used that adds transparency in the final model. Experimental studies using real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, this mapping must be based on an extensive comparison of both internal and external rating criteria. A substantial body of research has been undertaken of rating determinants for banks and large industrial corporations. However, the academic literature on insurers' rating determinants is very limited and fitness measures have not traditionally been provided. This paper proposes a three-step model to analyse rating determinants, and it is applied to a sample of European insurance firms. Firstly, a feature selection process is performed, that mixes statistical, Bayesian, and Machine Learning approaches. From selected features, several multivariate models are run, both in the statistical field (MDA, logit models) and the decision trees research area (C4.5, CART). Their accuracies are compared through bootstrapping strategies, and a final model is proposed. Results show that the feature selection process selects a small group of relevant attributes. Regarding multivariate models, the CART Gini oblique decision tree appears to be a good strategy, providing a quite satisfactory equilibrium between precision and comprehensibility. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In an increasingly globalized economy, bankruptcy results both in huge economic losses and tremendous social impact. While early prediction for a bankruptcy, if done appropriately, is of great importance to banks, insurance firms, creditors, and investors, the need of substantially more accurately predicting models becomes crucial. This problem has been approached by various methods ranging from statistics to machine learning, however they find a class decision estimate rather than a probabilistic confidence of the class distribution. In this paper we show that sparse Bayesian models also known as Relevance Vector Machine (RVMs) are superior to the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) therefore leading to predictors of choice. The advantage of RVM approach is that the classifier can yield a decision function that is much sparser than the SVM while maintaining its detection accuracy. This can lead to significant reduction in the computational complexity of the decision function, thereby making it more suitable for real-time applications. Preliminary experiments on Coface Data set (French credit risk provider) show that RVM classifiers outperform SVM, lead to more sparse and accurate prediction models. © 2006 IEEE.",,11,0,,,,undefined,

The bank that has the most accurate view of its credit risk will be the most profitable. One of the main pillars in the assessing credit risk is the estimated probability of default of each counterparty, i.e., the probability that a counterparty cannot meet its payment obligations in the horizon of one year. A credit rating system takes several characteristics of a counterparty as inputs and assigns this counterparty to a rating class. In essence, this system is a classifier whose classes lie on an ordinal scale. In this paper we apply linear regression ordinal logistic regression, and support vector machine techniques to the credit rating problem. The latter technique is a relatively new machine learning technique that was originally designed for the two-class problem. We propose two new techniques that incorporate the ordinal character of the credit rating problem into support vector machines.

In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy support vector machine to discriminate good creditors from bad ones. Because in credit scoring areas we usually cannot label one customer as absolutely good who is sure to repay in time, or absolutely bad who will default certainly, our new fuzzy support vector machine treats every sample as both positive and negative classes, but with different memberships. By this way we expect the new fuzzy support vector machine to have more generalization ability, while preserving the merit of insensitive to outliers, as the fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) proposed in previous papers.

However, one of their main drawbacks is the inherent replication of isomorphic subtrees, as a result of which the produced classifiers might become too large to be comprehensible by the human experts that have to validate them. Alternatively, decision diagrams, a generalization of decision trees taking on the form of a rooted, acyclic digraph instead of a tree, have occasionally been suggested as a potentially more compact representation. Their application in machine learning has nonetheless been criticized, because the theoretical size advantages of subgraph sharing did not always directly materialize in the relatively scarce reported experiments on real-world data. Therefore, in this paper, starting from a series of rule sets extracted from three real-life credit-scoring data sets, we will empirically assess to what extent decision diagrams are able to provide a compact visual description.

This is because there are different ways to define the misclassification rate mainly due to the sample that we use to check this rate. If we test how good the system is on the sample of customers we used to build the system, the results will be better than that we did the test on another sample.

For example, in several financial applications (loan approval, credit scoring, etc.) an applicant is asked to submit a processing fee with the application (Mookerjee and Mannino 1997). The processing fee may be used to validate the information entered in the application. From an economic standpoint, it is important that the cost of validating the information not exceed the processing fee. Traditional classification systems do not allow the decision maker to incorporate information acquisition cost constraint. We term the problem of designing a classification system, where information acquisition costs are considered, as the problem of classification with information acquisition cost constraint (CIACC). The CIACC problem is a NP hard problem and is very difficult to solve to optimality. Current computer-based medical diagnostic methods use neural networks, discriminant analysis and other machine learning approaches for medical diagnosis (Pendharkar et al. 1999). Most of these approaches do not allow the decision maker to incorporate the information acquisition cost constraints. For example, Turney (1995) argues that “the problem of cost-sensitive classification is medical diagnosis, where a doctor would like to balance the costs of various possible medical tests with the expected benefits of the tests for the patient.” Turney proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm and decision tree induction algorithm to develop a classification system that minimizes information acquisition and mis-classification costs.

An accurate estimation of risk, and its use in corporate or global financial risk models, could be translated into a more efficient use of resources. One important ingredient to accomplish this goal is to find accurate predictors of individual risk in the credit portfolios of institutions. In this context we make a comparative analysis of different statistical and machine learning modeling methods of classification on a mortgage loan data set with the motivation to understand their limitations and potential. We introduced a specific modeling methodology based on the study of error curves. Using state-of-the-art modeling techniques we built more than 9,000 models as part of the study. The results show that CART decision-tree models provide the best estimation for default with an average 8.31% error rate for a training sample of 2,000 records. As a result of the error curve analysis for this model we conclude that if more data were available, approximately 22,000 records, a potential 7.32% error rate could be achieved. Neural Networks provided the second best results with an average error of 11.00%. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm had an average error rate of 14.95%. These results outperformed the standard Probit algorithm which attained an average error rate of 15.13%.

The final model was able to correctly classify 96% of a testing set of four types of bank holding structures. Holding structure is defined as the number of banks under common ownership. For this study, forms of bank holding structure include: banks that are not owned by another company, single banks that are held by another firm, pairs of banks that are held by another enterprise, and three or more banks that are held by another company. Initially, input to the neural network model was 28 financial ratios for more than 200 banks in Arkansas for 1992. The 28 ratios are organized by categories such as liquidity, credit risk, leverage, efficiency, and profitability. The ratios were constructed with 70 bank variables such as net worth, deposits, total assets, net loans, total operating income, etc. The first neural network model correctly classified 84% of the testing set at a tolerance level of 0.20. Another artificial intelligence (AI) procedure known as two-dimensional rough sets was then applied to the dataset. Rough sets reduced the number of input variables from 28 to 18, a drop of 36% in the number of input variables. This version of rough sets also eliminated a number of records, thereby reducing the information system (i.e., matrix) on both vertical and horizontal dimensions. A second neural network was trained with the reduced number of input variables and records. This network correctly classified 96% of the testing set at a tolerance level of 0.20, an increase of 11% in the accuracy of the prediction. By applying two-dimensional reducts to the dataset of financial ratios, the predictive accuracy of the neural network model was improved substantially. Banking institutions that are prime candidates for mergers or acquisitions can then be more accurately identified through the use of this hybrid decision support system (DSS) which combines different types of AI techniques for the purposes of data management and modeling. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

In particular, it describes the development of an expert system for credit card application assessment. In the problem domain of credit assessment, the method of 'credit scoring' has been widely used, but this system uses a 'profiling' method to simulate more closely the human process of decision making. The authors have adopted a decision tree as a form of knowledge representation for the profile design, and a decision tree generating algorithm is described. Finally, the implemented system, called ACAS-PRO, is outlined.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

They involve judgmental procedures which are by nature non-deterministic. Artificial intelligence methods can be used to approach the problem from a different angle. This paper shows the feasibility of a multi-expert approach driven by a meta-model in assessing business risk. More precisely it describes the meta-expert as part of a knowledge-based system being developed to assist bank loan officers in assessing the activities of firms applying for a loan. The use of a meta-model to represent the expert's strategic reasoning has the advantage of offering adaptable systems capable of building dynamically the resolution strategy most suited to the problem to be solved. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.,Artificial Intelligence | credit risk assessment | expert system | meta-model loan granting,11,0,,,,undefined,
