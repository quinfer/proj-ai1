With the extensive research on consumer credit risk assessment in recent decades, the abundance of literature on this topic can be overwhelming for researchers. Therefore, this article aims to provide a more systematic and comprehensive analysis from three perspectives: classification algorithms, data traits, and learning methods. Firstly, the state-of-the-art classification algorithms are categorized into traditional single classifiers, intelligent single classifiers, hybrid and ensemble multiple classifiers. Secondly, considering the diversity of data traits in the credit dataset, data traits are divided into external structure information traits, data quality traits, data quantity traits, and internal information traits. Data traits-driven modeling framework based on multiple classifiers is proposed for solving credit risk assessment. Thirdly, considering the differences in data modeling methods, learning methods are classified into data status, label status, and structure form. Furthermore, model interpretability, model bias, model multi-pattern, and model fairness are discussed. Finally, the limitations and future research directions are presented.

Joint models for longitudinal and survival data is an appropriate framework to model the mutual evolution of the survival time and the endogenous time-varying covariates.

The strategy employs a two-pronged approach: (i) the government enhances the supply of loanable funds to banks, and (ii) identifies good SME borrowers through skills development programs and introduces them to banks. This model will reduce default risk and allow banks to offer lower-interest and collateral-free credit to SMEs, thereby improving their access to finance and performance. Second, the model could be extended to accommodate digital finance using a data-driven credit risk score of the borrowers to reduce banks’ default risks and transaction costs with or without government funds.

Therefore, many credit scoring methods have been proposed in the past to address this issue.

With rapid growth in the number of customers adopting online banking services, such interaction information plays a significant role in assessing their credit score. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable credit scoring approach called CDGAT (Graph attention network for credit card defaulters) for predicting potential credit card defaulters. In CDGAT, a customer’s credit score is calculated based on transaction embedding and neighborhood embedding. To obtain the neighborhood embedding, CDGAT first utilizes the Amount-bias Sampling (AbS) strategy to extract a subgraph for each customer. Next, CDGAT directly aggregates neighbors’ features according to their influence weights. The experimental results on the dataset from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited (ICBC (Macau)) show that CDGAT significantly outperforms the baseline methods.

In practice, however, the parameters must be estimated and this introduces an additional source of uncertainty that is usually not accounted for. The Prudential Regulators have formally raised the issue of errors stemming from the internal model estimation process in the context of credit risk, calling for margins of conservatism to cover possible underestimation in capital. Notwithstanding this requirement, to date, a solution shared by banks and regulators/supervisors has not yet been found. In our paper, we investigate the effect of the estimation error in the framework of the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) model that represents the baseline for the derivation of the credit risk measures under the Internal-Ratings Based (IRB) approach. We exploit Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the bias induced by the estimation error and we explore an approach to correct for this bias. Our approach involves only the estimation of the long run average probability of default and not the estimation of the asset correlation given that, in practice, banks are not allowed to modify this parameter. We study the stochastic characteristics of the probability of default estimator that can be derived from the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor framework and we show how to introduce a correction to control for the estimation error. Our approach does not require introducing in the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor model additional elements like the prior distributions or other parameters which, having to be estimated, would introduce another source of estimation error. This simple and easily implemented correction ensures that the probability of observing an exception (i.e. a default rate higher than the estimated quantile of the default rate distribution) is equal to the desired confidence level. We show a practical application of our approach relying on real data.",Basel 2 | Margin of Conservatism | Regulation | Value-at-Risk,0,0,repositoryam,Green,MIUR,undefined,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca"

Thus, the impact on the eligibility of those models from a statistical and economic point of view. Especially for the models used in the peer-to-peer lending platforms, since their rejection rate is extremely high. The method of inferring rejected applicants information in the process of construction of the credit scoring models is known as reject inference. This study proposes a semi-supervised learning framework based on hidden Markov models (SSHMM), as a novel method of reject inference.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach based on in-depth interviews with casino executives, government officials and gamblers to probe their perspectives on Macao's gaming credit practices was adopted due to its underresearched nature. Documentary analysis of annual reports and court files was also used. Findings: Despite the potential of increased revenue with more credit, the credit risk for gaming concessionaires remained under control, while VIP-rooms and junket operators have adopted more prudent policy and faced substantial challenge in credit collection. All these would lead to greater alignment with law-based credit practices. Research limitations/implications: Since gaming credit information was considered confidential, the author experienced difficulty in arranging the interviews, and the nonprobability sampling characterized by the selection bias might affect the findings. Practical implications: The findings have demonstrated some major credit practices such as credit charges on credit balances and terms and conditions for repayment for different credit providers in Macao. Originality/value: The different credit practices by credit providers at different levels of gaming credit have been presented in the same paper.",Credit practice | Gaming credit | Macao,0,0,,,,undefined,

Existing methods in traditional finance are not directly applicable to microfinance due to the following unique characteristics: (a) insufficient prior loan histories to establish a credit scoring system; (b) applicants may have difficulty providing all the information required by MFIs to predict default probabilities accurately, and (c) many MFIs use group liability (instead of collateral) to secure repayment. In this paper, we present a novel control-theoretic model of microfinance that accounts for these characteristics and an algorithm to optimize the financing decision in real-time. We characterize the convergence conditions to Pareto-optimum. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces fast decisions and is robust against missing information while still accounting for financial inclusion, fairness, social welfare, sustainability, and the complexities induced by group liability.

Our experiments were conducted using Depresjon, Psykose and D-Vlog. We identify that both data and algorithmic bias exist. Second, we analyse strategies that can be deployed at the pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing stages to mitigate for bias and evaluate their effectiveness. Third, we investigate factors that impact the efficacy of existing bias mitigation strategies and outline recommendations to achieve greater gender fairness for mental health.

In this work, we consider the potential bias based on protected attributes (e.g., race and gender), and tackle this problem by learning latent representations of individuals that are statistically indistinguishable between protected groups while sufficiently preserving other information for classification. To do that, we develop a minimax adversarial framework with a generator to capture the data distribution and generate latent representations, and a critic to ensure that the distributions across different protected groups are similar. Our framework provides theoretical guarantee with respect statistical parity and individual fairness. Empirical results on four real-world datasets also show that the learned representation can effectively be used for classification tasks such as credit risk prediction while obstructing information related to protected groups, especially when removing protected attributes is not sufficient for fair classification.",Adversarial framework | Fairness | Latent representations,0,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Thus, we study the feasibility of mitigating racial bias in developing a credit scoring model. By using a data set provided by a P2P lending platform, LendingClub, we integrated the C5.0 decision tree algorithm and the reweighing fairness algorithm to develop credit scoring models with cost-sensitive modeling concepts. Multi-class fair credit scoring evaluation was also studied in terms of performance indices, including accuracy, average cost, and unfairness metrics. The results demonstrated that the reweighing fairness algorithm reduced the unfairness and average cost of models.

Loan costs are generally higher for nonconventional conforming loans with higher levels of credit risks (loans with higher combined loan-to-value, higher debt-to-income ratios, and for investment properties). This implies that product and borrower risk impact loan costs. However, borrower characteristics such as income and race/ethnicity are also associated with differences in loan costs even after controlling for loan characteristics, location, and lender fixed effects. Total loan costs are higher both in dollar terms and as a share of the loan amount for Black borrowers and Hispanic borrowers, and total loan costs represent a higher share of the loan amount for lower income borrowers. These disparities are larger in neighborhoods with higher levels of lender concentration and implicit racial bias. These findings suggest that in addition to access to mortgages and interest rates, loan costs can represent a barrier for access to homeownership with a disparate impact for Black and Hispanic borrowers, which contributes to perpetuate the homeownership gap.",borrowing constraints | homeownership | homeownership gap | Mortgage loan costs,0,0,,,,undefined,

Algorithmic credit scoring (ACS) is increasingly used to assess borrowers' creditworthiness, using technology to glean non-traditional data from smartphones and analyze them through machine-learning algorithms. These processes promise efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness compared with traditional credit scoring. However, this technology raises public concerns about opacity, unfair discrimination, and threats to individual privacy and autonomy. Many countries in Southeast Asia are introducing ACS in consumer finance markets, although - even with the significant concerns raised - there is an ongoing and concerning lag in oversight and regulation of the process. Regulation is vital to delivering big data and AI promises in the financial services market, while ensuring fairness and public interest. This article utilizes Vietnam, where the lending industry deploys ACS but in a situation of legal limbo, as a case-study to analyze the consequences of this technology. Vietnam is one of the foremost Southeast Asian countries in which ACS usage is spreading rapidly, and this provides an excellent opportunity to review the regulation, or lack thereof, and determine the implications that this may have for other countries that are currently introducing ACS in consumer finance markets.

Therefore, this research attempts to answer how organisations can mitigate AI risks that relate to unfair decision outcomes. We take a holistic view by analyzing the challenges throughout a typical AI product life cycle while focusing on the critical question of how rather broadly defined fairness principles may be translated into day-to-day practical solutions at the organizational level. We report on an exploratory case study of a social impact microfinance organization that is using AI-enabled credit scoring to support the screening process to particularly financially marginalized entrepreneurs.

However, most credit scoring models face the challenge of reject inference, which refers to the lack of post-loan performance data for rejected applicants, leading to sample selection bias and inaccurate credit assessment. Traditional credit scoring methods tackle this issue by assuming that the missing labels for rejected samples are missing at random (MAR) and by measuring sample similarity directly in the original feature space. Nevertheless, these strategies are not suitable for real-world business scenarios. Inspired by metric learning and transductive learning, we propose a novel credit scoring model called transductive semi-supervised metric network (TSSMN), which formalizes reject inference as a semi-supervised binary classification problem with the prior assumption of missing not at random (MNAR). TSSMN consists of two interconnected modules: the embedding metric network (EMN) that maps samples from the original feature space to the metric space for similarity measurement, and the transductive propagation network (TPN) that performs label propagation based on sample similarity. We evaluate TSSMN on a real-world credit dataset and compare it with traditional credit scoring methods. The results indicate that TSSMN can overcome sample selection bias and more accurately classify credit applicants. Therefore, TSSMN has the potential to enhance credit risk assessment in real-world business scenarios.",Biological system modeling | Business | Credit scoring | Data models | Hidden Markov models | Mathematical models | Measurement | metric learning | reject inference | Support vector machines | transductive learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

It uses baseline regression to identify moderation of fintech controlling gross domestic products, size, return on assets and leverage. The findings are confirmed using robustness against key variable bias. It also uses a dynamic panel two-stage generalized method of moments for endogeneity. Findings: The study finds that the fintech awareness and adoption are not the same across all Islamic countries. The Asia Pacific region is far ahead of the other two regions where Indonesia is ahead in terms of fintech awareness and adoption, and Malaysia is ahead in terms of reaping its benefits in credit risk management. Fintech affects prefinancing credit risk significantly more than postfinancing credit risk. Also, the study finds that Islamic banks suffer from the problem of “Adverse selection under Shariah compliance.” Practical implications: This research invites regulators to introduce fintech in Islamic banks on war footing. Similar studies can be conducted on the role of other risks such as operational and market risks. Fintech will also help in improving the risk profile and stability of Islamic banks against systemic risks and financial crises. Originality/value: This research has variety of originalities. First, it is the pioneering study that addresses the effect of fintech pre- and post-financing credit risks in Islamic banks. Second, it identifies “Adverse selection under Shariah compliance” for Islamic banks.

As an example, the credit-worthiness-assessment task is now strongly based on Machine Learning algorithms that make decisions independently from humans. Several studies showed remarkable improvement in reliability, customer care, and return on investment. Nonetheless, many users remain sceptical since they perceive the whole as only partially transparent. The trust in the system decision, the guarantee of fairness in the decision-making process, the explanation of the reasons behind the decision are just some of the open challenges for this task. Moreover, from the financial institution's perspective, another compelling problem is credit-repayment monitoring. Even here, traditional models (e.g., credit scorecards) and machine learning models can help the financial institution in identifying, at an early stage, customers that will fall into default on payments. The monitoring task is critical for the debt-repayment success of identifying bad debtors or simply users who are momentarily in difficulty. The financial institution can thus prevent possible defaults and, if possible, meet the debtor's needs. In this work, the authors propose an architecture for a Creditworthiness-Assessment duty that can meet the transparency needs of the customers while monitoring the credit-repayment risk. This preliminary study carried out an experimental evaluation of the component devoted to the credit-score computation and monitoring credit repayments.

We also find that the least-squares support vector classifiers (LSSVCs) hardly identify important instances and features from data, so they cannot give an interpretable prediction. Although the LSSVC has the properties of low bias and high robustness, its high variance often gives a poor predictive performance. In this paper, we propose an alternating minimization-based sparse least-squares classifier (AMSLC) approach in the framework of LSSVCs to address the aforementioned problems. Based on the reconstructed row- and column-wise kernel matrices, the sparsity-induced ℓ0-norm approximation function is introduced to the LSSVC model. By alternately solving two unconstrained quadratic optimization problems or two systems of linear equations, AMSLC can predict the class labels of given instances and extract the least number of important instances and features to obtain the interpretable classification. Compared with SVC, LSSVC, ℓ1-norm SVC (L1SVC), ℓ0-norm SVC (L0SVC), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator classifier (LASSOC), and multiple kernel learning SVC (MKLSVC) on four real credit datasets, the experimental results show that the proposed AMSLC method generally obtains the best predictive accuracy and the interpretable classification with the minimum number of important instances and features.",classification | credit risk | Least-squares | multiple kernel learning | sparse learning | support vector classifier,2,0,,,NSFC,BZ2020008,National Natural Science Foundation of China

For example, in autonomous driving, an object classification model should achieve high detection rates under different conditions of weather, distance, etc. Similarly, in the financial setting, credit-scoring models must not discriminate against minority groups. These conditions or groups are called as 'Data Slices'. In product MLOps cycles, product developers must identify such critical data slices and adapt models to mitigate data slice problems. Discovering where models fail, understanding why they fail, and mitigating these problems, are therefore essential tasks in the MLOps life-cycle. In this paper, we present SliceTeller, a novel tool that allows users to debug, compare and improve machine learning models driven by critical data slices. SliceTeller automatically discovers problematic slices in the data, helps the user understand why models fail. More importantly, we present an efficient algorithm, SliceBoosting, to estimate trade-offs when prioritizing the optimization over certain slices. Furthermore, our system empowers model developers to compare and analyze different model versions during model iterations, allowing them to choose the model version best suitable for their applications. We evaluate our system with three use cases, including two real-world use cases of product development, to demonstrate the power of SliceTeller in the debugging and improvement of product-quality ML models.",Data Slicing | Data Validation | Data-Centric AI | Human-in-the-loop | Model Evaluation | Model Validation,5,0,,,,undefined,

To address this challenge, we first harness the internal ratings-based approach to identify up to 13 risk components that we classify into 3 main categories—statistics, technology, and market conduct. Second, to evaluate the importance of each risk category, we collect a series of regulatory documents related to three potential use cases—regulatory capital, credit scoring, or provisioning—and we compute the weight of each category according to the intensity of their mentions, using natural language processing and a risk terminology based on expert knowledge. Finally, we test our framework using popular ML models in credit risk, and a publicly available database, to quantify some proxies of a subset of risk factors that we deem representative. We measure the statistical risk according to the number of hyperparameters and the stability of the predictions. The technological risk is assessed through the transparency of the algorithm and the latency of the ML training method, while the market conduct risk is quantified by the time it takes to run a post hoc technique (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the output.",Artificial intelligence | Bias | Credit risk | Internal ratings based model | Interpretability | IRB model | Machine learning | Natural language processing | NLP,5,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Traditionally, credit-risk management relies on credit scoring that predicts loans’ probability of default. In this paper, we use a profit scoring approach that is based on modeling the annualized adjusted internal rate of returns of loans. To validate our profit scoring models with traditional credit scoring models, we use data from a European P2P lending market, Bondora, and also a random sample of loans from the Lending Club P2P lending market. We compare the out-of-sample accuracy and profitability of the credit and profit scoring models within several classes of statistical and machine learning models including the following: logistic and linear regression, lasso, ridge, elastic net, random forest, and neural networks. We found that our approach outperforms standard credit scoring models for Lending Club and Bondora loans. More specifically, as opposed to credit scoring models, returns across all loans are 24.0% (Bondora) and 15.5% (Lending Club) higher, whereas accuracy is 6.7% (Bondora) and 3.1% (Lending Club) higher for the proposed profit scoring models. Moreover, our results are not driven by manual selection as profit scoring models suggest investing in more loans. Finally, even if we consider data sampling bias, we found that the set of superior models consists almost exclusively of profit scoring models. Thus, our results contribute to the literature by suggesting a paradigm shift in modeling credit-risk in the P2P market to prefer profit as opposed to credit-risk scoring models.",Credit scoring | Financial intermediation | Fintech | P2P | Profit scoring,6,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,H2020,1/0497/21,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs an alternative stochastic profit efficiency framework and introduces nonmonotonic effects by parameterizing the location and scale parameters of the inefficiency component on an unbalanced panel data set of 72 commercial banks in the 2008–2019 period. Marginal effects across quartiles are calculated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap procedure of 500 simulations. The study disaggregates across ownership and size for gauging the impact of structure on the associations between determinants of profit efficiency. Findings: The study partially rejects the productivity paradox as it discovers a negative association of IT and R&D with profit inefficiency. However, the observed nonmonotonicity of IT is of significance for bank managers, as the study concludes that overinvestment in IT is detrimental to a bank’s profit-maximizing interests. Further, bank size, loan default and credit risk depict a nonmonotonic relationship across the sample with large banks, high NPAs and high credit risk associated with reducing profit efficiency. In addition, higher margins and greater diversification are related positively to efficiency, and banks with cost-heavy structures or having high liquidity risk associated negatively with efficiency.

Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major tool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency, explainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction accuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the model accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates explainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with regulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are unlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet regulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and enforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the neural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes monotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of training a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a neural additive model, as a free lunch. We demonstrate through empirical results that our new model is as accurate as black-box fully-connected neural networks, providing a highly accurate and regulated machine learning method.",fairness | model explainability | neural networks,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In the literature, there have been a number of studies concerning credit risk management, often involving credit scoring systems making use of machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the specificity of individual banks’ datasets means that choosing the techniques best suited to the needs of a given bank is far from straightforward. This study was motivated by the need by Credins Bank in Tirana for a reliable customer credit scoring tool suitable for use with that bank’s specific dataset. The dataset in question presents two substantial difficulties: first, a high degree of imbalance, and second, a high level of bias together with a low level of confidence in the recorded data. These shortcomings are largely due to the relatively young age of the private banking system in Albania, which did not exist as such until the early 2000s. They are shortcomings not encountered in the more conventional datasets that feature in the literature. The present study therefore has a real contribution to make to the existing corpus of research on credit scoring. The first important question to be addressed is the level of imbalance. In practice, the proportion of good customers may be many times that of bad customers, making the impact of unbalanced data on classification models an important element to be considered. The second question relates to bias or incompleteness in customer information in emerging and developing countries, where economies tend to function with a large amount of informality. Our objective in this study was identifying the most appropriate ML methods to handle Credins Bank’s specific dataset, and the various tests that we performed for this purpose yielded abundant numerical results.

In fact, Apple has recently been investigated for gender discrimination in assigning a credit limit to its users, demonstrating that there may still be inherent biases in the development of such algorithms and models. Furthermore, biases in financial services models may not only lead to unfair discrimination but were also linked to health problems and recovery prospects. This project aims to analyse and identify the different types of biases found in AI models and data used in the financial services industry. We propose a method using data analysis and explainable models to explain how these biases emerge throughout the process of developing AI models as well as applying state-of-The-Art bias dealing techniques to avoid and mitigate them. Finally, we propose how to evaluate these models according to the business objectives and consider possible trade-offs between different definitions of fairness. Thus, the main questions that this project will try to answer are as follows:-What are the current biases in credit risk and fraud detection models and how to identify them?-In what ways understanding how biases emerge from the data can help us in bias mitigation?-To what extent could credit risk and fraud detection models bias be mitigated, and what are the implications of those mitigation techniques? Answering these questions, we hope to create a pipeline for building these models by understanding the key points where bias can emerge and the appropriate methods to avoid it.",bias | fairness | financial services | machine learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

In this paper, we introduce a new approach to handle fairness by formulating a stochastic multi-objective optimization problem for which the corresponding Pareto fronts uniquely and comprehensively define the accuracy-fairness trade-offs.

When most credit risk models are built using only applicants who had been funded for credit, such non-random sampling predominantly influenced by credit policymakers and previous loan performances may introduce sampling bias to the models, and thus alter their prediction of default on loan repayment when screening applications from prospective borrowers. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method that aims to identify and pseudo-label parts of the historically declined loan applications to mitigate sampling bias in the training data. We also introduce a new measure to assess the performance from the business perspective, loan application approval rates at various loan default rate levels.

The experiment and early production results from deployed model show that self-training method with calibrated probability as data augmentation selection criteria improved the ability of credit scoring to differentiate default loan applications and, more importantly, can increase loan approval rate up to 8.8%, while keeping similar default rate comparing to baselines.

The empirical results substantiate the evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions.

The traditionally accepted approach to explainable credit risk modeling involves generating scores with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) - usually logistic regression, calculating the contribution of each predictor to the total points lost from the theoretical maximum, and generating reason codes based on the 4 or 5 most impactful predictors. The industry standard approach is not directly applicable to a more expressive and flexible class of nonlinear models known as neural networks.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a sample of syndicated bank loans granted to United States (US) listed firms from 1992 to 2014 and adopt the loan yield spread (Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay slice) as the main proxy for the cost of debt (executive pay disparity). The authors also use the Heckman two-stage model to address the sample selection bias and the two-stage least squares and propensity score matching methods to control the potential endogeneity issues. To test different views about executive pay disparity, the authors adopt the cash-to-stock ratio to proxy for managerial risk-shifting incentives. Findings: The authors find that the cost of debt is significantly higher for firms with larger executive pay disparity, which is robust to sample selection bias, endogeneity concerns, alternative measures and various controls. This positive relationship increases with the risk-shifting incentives of CEOs instead of other top executives, which supports the managerial power view, and is stronger for firms with higher levels of financial distress. The findings suggest that creditors view executive pay disparity are associated with higher credit risk and CEO entrenchment. Originality/value: This paper reveals one “dark” side of executive pay disparity: it increases the cost of debt and identifies a significant role played by CEOs' risk-shifting incentives. The authors provide direct evidence of the relevance of pay differential to corporate credit analysis.",Cost of debt | Executive pay disparity | Financial distress | Risk-shifting incentives,2,0,,,,undefined,

Given the sensitive regulatory uses of these models and the concerns raised in the industry about the effect of model misspecification on capital and reserves, our conclusion is that validation methods chosen in the stress testing context should be capable of testing model assumptions.

Taking advantage of the broad applicability of semiparametric models, we propose some novel and improved methods to estimate the regression coefficients of generalized partially linear models (GPLM). This model extends the generalized linear model by adding a nonparametric component. Like in parametric models, variable selection is important in the GPLM to single out the inactive covariates for the response. Instead of deleting inactive covariates, our approach uses them as auxiliary information in the estimation procedure. We then define two models, one that includes all the covariates and another that includes the active covariates only. We then combine these two model estimators optimally to form the pretest and shrinkage estimators. Asymptotic properties are studied to derive the asymptotic biases and risks of the proposed estimators. We show that if the shrinkage dimension exceeds two, the asymptotic risks of the shrinkage estimators are strictly less than those of the full model estimators. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation methods. We then apply our proposed methods to two real data sets. Our simulation and real data results show that the proposed estimators perform with higher accuracy and lower variability in the estimation of regression parameters for GPLM compared with competing estimation methods.",Asymptotic biases and risks | backfitting algorithm | credit scoring | maximum likelihood estimation | pretest estimator | semiparametrics | shrinkage estimator | Speckman estimator | variable selection,0,0,,,UM,undefined,University of Manitoba

We explain these findings with a simple and generalizable statistical discrimination model where banks hold prior beliefs of repayment probability based on the applicant’s group and observe noisy signals of creditworthiness. Our model predicts that differences in loan denial rates across groups are more pronounced at middle range values and disappear at very high and very low credit scores.

Fairness and other ethical issues are often one of the main concerns in decision making. In this work, we define a formal framework for the fairness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning decision models, where we adopt one of the most popular notions of fairness in the literature based on the intuition—any two similar individuals must be treated similarly and are thus unbiased. We show that quantum noise can improve fairness and develop an algorithm to check whether a (noisy) quantum machine learning model is fair. In particular, this algorithm can find bias kernels of quantum data (encoding individuals) during checking. These bias kernels generate infinitely many bias pairs for investigating the unfairness of the model. Our algorithm is designed based on a highly efficient data structure—Tensor Networks—and implemented on Google’s TensorFlow Quantum. The utility and effectiveness of our algorithm are confirmed by the experimental results, including income prediction and credit scoring on real-world data, for a class of random (noisy) quantum decision models with 27 qubits (2 27 -dimensional state space) tripling (2 18 times more than) that of the state-of-the-art algorithms for verifying quantum machine learning models.",Fairness Verification | Quantum Decision Model | Quantum Machine Learning | Quantum Noise,0,1,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,61832015,National Natural Science Foundation of China

When a financial institution wants to build a model to predict the default of credit applicants, the institution only has a known good/bad outcome loan status for the accepted applicants; this causes an inherent bias in the model. Reject inference is used to infer the good or bad loan status of credit applicants that were rejected by a financial institution. This paper presents a reject inference technique in which a semi-supervised framework is developed using a Naive Bayes model. The framework uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to incorporate rejected applicants into the parameter estimation of the model using a bootstrapping approach. The proposed method has an advantage over traditional reject inference methods because the rejected applicant data will participate in the estimation of the model parameters, thus avoiding the extrapolation problem.

Their superior accuracy compared to parametric model alternatives has been demonstrated repeatedly in the literature. However, the statistical independence of the data implicitly assumed by resampling-based error estimates is unlikely to hold in a real estate context as price-formation processes in property markets are inherently spatial, which leads to spatial dependence structures in the data. When performing conventional cross-validation techniques for model selection and model assessment, spatial dependence between training and test data may lead to undetected overfitting and overoptimistic perception of predictive power. This study sheds light on the bias in cross-validation errors of tree-based algorithms induced by spatial autocorrelation and proposes a bias-reduced spatial cross-validation strategy. The findings confirm that error estimates from non-spatial resampling methods are overly optimistic, whereas spatially conscious techniques are more dependable and can increase generalizability.

In this work, we find that the default/non-default classification task and the rejection/approval classification task are highly correlated, according to both real-world data study and theoretical analysis.

Accordingly, we for the first time propose to model the biased credit scoring data with Multi-Task Learning (MTL).

RMT-Net leverages the relation between the two tasks that the larger the rejection probability, the more the default/non-default task needs to learn from the rejection/approval task. Furthermore, we extend RMT-Net to RMT-Net++ for modeling scenarios with multiple rejection/approval strategies. Extensive experiments are conducted on several datasets, and strongly verifies the effectiveness of RMT-Net on both approved and rejected samples.

It is unclear if the bias-variance trade- off of regularization techniques can improve the predictions of PD in non-random sample selection setting. To address this, we propose the use of Lasso and adaptive Lasso for variable selection and optimal predictive accuracy.

However, enforcing such constraints blindly can lead to undesirable trade-offs between group-level accuracy if groups possess different underlying sampled population metrics, an occurrence that is surprisingly common in real-world applications like credit risk and income classification. Similarly, attempts to relax hard constraints may lead to unintentional degradation in classification performance, without benefit to any demographic group. In these increasingly likely scenarios, we make the case for transparent human intervention in making the trade-offs between the accuracies of demographic groups. We propose that transparency in trade-offs between demographic groups should be a key tenet of ML design and implementation. Our evaluation demonstrates that a transparent human-in-the-loop trade-off technique based on the Pareto principle increases both overall and group-level accuracy by 9.5% and 9.6% respectively, in two commonly explored UCI datasets for credit risk and income classification.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

In various applications, ranging from industrial quality control to public health through credit risk analysis for instance, training observations can be right censored, meaning that, rather than on independent copies of (X, Y ), statistical learning relies on a collection of n ≥ 1 independent realizations of the triplet (X, min{Y, C}, δ), where C is a nonnegative random variable with unknown distribution, modelling censoring and δ = I{Y ≤ C} indicates whether the duration is right censored or not. As ignoring censoring in the risk computation may clearly lead to a severe underestimation of the target duration and jeopardize prediction, we consider a plug-in estimate of the true risk based on a Kaplan-Meier estimator of the conditional survival function of the censoring C given X, referred to as Beran risk, in order to perform empirical risk minimization. It is established, under mild conditions, that the learning rate of minimizers of this biased/weighted empirical risk functional is of order (Formula Presented) when ignoring model bias issues inherent to plug-in estimation, as can be attained in absence of censoring.

At the macroeconomic level, this translates into positive estimates for economic growth. On a micro scale, instead, the use of AI in credit analysis improves financial inclusion and access to credit for traditionally underserved borrowers.

Critically this estimation is intertwined with the competing risk a customer fully repays their loan while also having key predictive drivers with values that change over time. A conventional model in this setting is a competing risks Cox Model with time-varying covariates. However partial likelihood estimation of this model has two shortcomings: (1) the baseline hazard is not estimated, so calculating probabilities requires a further estimation step; and (2) a covariance matrix for both regression coefficients and the baseline hazard is not produced. This paper caters for these shortcomings by devising a maximum likelihood technique to jointly estimate regression coefficients and the cause-specific baseline hazards using constrained optimisation to ensure the latter’s non-negativity. We show via simulation our technique produces regression coefficients estimates with lower bias in small samples with heavy censoring. When applied to a real-world credit risk dataset consisting of home loan data our Maximum Likelihood approach produces a smoother estimate of the cause-specific baseline hazards for default and redemption than those obtained using the Partial Likelihood and Breslow approach. This provides better clarity of the shape of these functions through both a less volatile central estimate as well as quantifying the error of this central estimate.

Techniques such as extreme gradient boosting, random forest and support vector machines are challenging to interpret. This restricts the commercial application of these techniques as they lack transparency and often hide potential biases inherited by the machine learning algorithms. Ultimately, this further limits the ability of these techniques to assess an individual's ability to pay for a loan. The biases lead to credit applications being rejected or individuals being offered ""unfair""credit terms based on their credit risk. Recently there have been attempts to predict credit default risk in literature. However, the majority of studies are conducted using data from developed countries, where most individuals are banked and data is complete. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and compare statistical classification techniques and machine learning techniques, with the focus being on interpreting the results and explaining which features contribute to the credit approval processes that may excel in both developed and developing countries. To achieve this goal, we explored three datasets from FinTech organisations, namely Home Credit, Xente, and Super Lender. Two of the datasets are from Uganda and Nigeria (developing countries in Africa) and one from the USA (a developed country in North America). We adopted Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to interpret the models. Using SHAP, we identified that for all three datasets, the external ratings, total due and loan duration increase the likelihood of an individual defaulting on a loan.

Furthermore, by expanding the time window in our regression analysis, we observe that the influence of ESG and its constituents strongly varies over time. We argue that these dynamics may be due to financial and regulatory shocks. In a sector decomposition, we additionally find that the energy sector is most influenced by ESG regarding the probability of corporate credit default.

Based on the Lending Club’s peer-to-peer loans dataset and Taiwanese credit card clients dataset, relative to individual base models, the proposed entropy-based stacking model provides more consistent performance across multiple data environments and less biased performance in terms of default classification.

Traditional approaches are easily influenced by sample selection bias because they use accepted applicant samples only, while the applicant population also includes rejected applicants. Reject inference is a technique to infer good/bad labels for rejected applicants, which can overcome biases in credit scoring. However, previously proposed reject inference methods usually ignore the imbalanced distribution in accepted data, which means that good applicants are much more than bad ones in most practical consumer loan applications. Both the neglect of rejected data and the imbalanced distribution in accepted data weaken the performance of current credit scoring models. In this paper, we propose a novel reject inference framework that takes into account the imbalanced data distribution for consumer credit scoring. First, we use an advanced graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to solve the reject inference problem, which is called label spreading. Second, faced with an imbalanced distribution of good and bad samples in accepted applicants, we conduct imbalanced learning using a modified Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique before reject inference. Then, six binary classifiers are studied in our proposed framework for credit scoring modeling. Finally, we present the results of four exact experiments as well as online A/B tests for performance evaluation using data provided by a leading Chinese fintech company. Empirical results indicate that the proposed framework performs better than traditional scoring models across different evaluation metrics, representing a progressive method that promotes credit scoring research as well as improving fintech practices.",Credit scoring | Financial technology | Imbalanced learning | Label spreading | Reject inference | Semi-supervised learning,11,0,,,,2018YFC0213600,Key Technologies Research and Development Program

Their imbalanced structures may cause statistical bias and poor performance of those traditional models. Hence, how to properly deal with them and dig useful information from them are very crucial for the risk management. This paper proposes a new approach to address the imbalanced data classification in this area by directly generating two quadratic surfaces in the original space. In this way, it avoids the time-consuming task for searching a proper kernel function and its corresponding parameters in the traditional support vector machine (SVM) models, hence significantly improve the total efficiency of the approach. Moreover, the homocentric structure and maximization margin principle are applied to obtain a good performance of our model on the issue. Besides, fuzzy weight is also incorporated to further increase the classification accuracy and robustness. It is worth noting that the linear programming structure of our model not only guarantees the global optimality of its solution, but also leads to a much higher efficiency than those benchmark models. In addition, the fewer parameters in our model further saves more time in the tuning process. Hence it is quite suitable for handling those huge-sized problems in this big data era. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive experiment to compare the performances and efficiencies of different methods.

The prevalence of machine learning techniques has raised concerns about the potential for learned algorithms to become biased against certain groups. Many definitions have been proposed in the literature, but the fundamental task of reasoning about probabilistic events is a challenging one, owing to the intractability of inference. The focus of this paper is taking steps towards the application of tractable probabilistic models to fairness in machine learning. Tractable probabilistic models have recently emerged that guarantee that conditional marginal can be computed in time linear in the size of the model. In particular, we show that sum product networks (SPNs) enable an effective technique for determining the statistical relationships between protected attributes and other training variables. We will also motivate the concept of “fairness through percentile equivalence”, a new definition predicated on the notion that individuals at the same percentile of their respective distributions should be treated equivalently, and this prevents unfair penalisation of those individuals who lie at the extremities of their respective distributions. We compare the efficacy of this pre-processing technique with an alternative approach that assumes an additive contribution. It was found that when these two approaches were compared on a data set containing the results of law school applicants, the percentile equivalence method reduced the average underestimation in the exam score of ethnic minority applicants black applicants at the bottom end of their conditional distribution by about a fifth.

Our evidence shows that the proposal put forward by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2017 is the proposal which leads to the most evenly distributed impact across countries, in terms of CET1 ratio decline. That proposal targets the goals of risk sensitivity and diversification, with two independent instruments: rating-based risk weights and concentration add-ons. As a consequence, it is the only proposal which introduces an incentive for banks located in all countries, whether low rated or high rated, to reduce their home bias. Some proposals focus on one objective only: either risk sensitivity or diversification. Others introduce heavy penalization for banks located in low-rated countries, without addressing the home bias of banks located in high-rated countries. Several options are prone to pro-cyclicality, and we measure this effect by simulating the impact of a two-notch downgrading of high debt countries on the CET1 ratio of banks.

We investigate a novel metric, cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of balance between treatment and control groups. The proposed approach provides direct and automatic balancing of covariate distributions. In addition, the AUC-based approach is able to detect subtler distributional differences than existing measures, such as simple empirical mean/variance and count-based metrics. Thus, optimizing AUCs achieves a greater balance than the existing methods. Using 5 widely used real data sets and 7 synthetic data sets, we show that optimization of samples using existing methods (Chi-square, mean variance differences, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, and Mahalanobis) results in samples containing imbalance that is detectable using machine learning ensembles. We minimize covariate imbalance by minimizing the absolute value of the distance of the maximum cross-validated AUC on M folds from 0.50, using evolutionary optimization. We demonstrate that particle swarm optimization (PSO) outperforms modified cuckoo swarm (MCS) for a gradient-free, non-linear noisy cost function. To compute AUCs, we use supervised binary classification approaches from the machine learning and credit scoring literature. Using superscore ensembles adds to the classifier-based two-sample testing literature.

The corporate loan from financial institution increases financial www.earticle.net institution's credit exposure. Because measurement of the impact on the credit risk in the financial institution is used in determining the pricing model and structure of loan products, it is an essential factor for the financial institution that affects its profit structure. In terms of risk management, predicting delinquency using loan data is necessary for 5,000 Korean financial institutions. In several studies, bankruptcy forecasting was conducted on listed companies that disclosed financial and stock price information. However, this study increases the practical utility by extending the analysis target to individual entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs). In addition, this study presents representative big data analysis results by utilizing loan, delinquency, and technology credit information of approximately 1.1 million corporations, which is 20% of almost 5.6 million domestic sole proprietors and non-listed corporations. For loan data, it includes ten monthly loan type codes and eleven overdue reason codes. Prediction targets are separated by individual and corporate entrepreneurs. Also, analyses are divided by use of the processed dataset. For efficient analysis, the data dimension was reduced by changing the table structure through nested iterative operations while expanding the variable composition from a table consisting of N rows to one column. To reflect the characteristics of the data as much as possible, exploratory data analysis and feature-engineering were performed to process the data. Also, classification models are classified by four groups using a parametric method that nine models train for classification. Group 1 consists of Logistic Regression and Linear discriminant analysis based on the parametric method, group 2 consists of several algorithms that calculate the distance for model learning. In addition, group 3 consists of tree-based algorithms, which are also non-parametric methods. Group 4 consists of the semi-parametric method, which is deep neural network. However, out of the total 438,697 corporations, 810 defaulted, accounting for only 0.2% of the forecast, so the target distribution is severely imbalanced. For this reason, before model fitting, under sampling of imbalanced data was performed. The bias of the sampled training and validation data is minimized by performing. K-fold cross validation as much as the level of K=5. Finally, the analysis result suggests a significant effect on classification performance when the processed data is used. However, this study suggests no significant effect on performance when loan owner's characteristics are included. Moreover, tech-credit rating (TCB) information gives any meaningful effect regarding the type of corporation. Also, classification with Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is based on the Semi-parametric method, makes the best performance of binary classification. Non-parametric and Non-tree based models are not appropriate methods for analyzing loan data. In the case of the DNN based on the semi-parametric methodology, the highest classification performance was confirmed for all analyses and entrepreneurs' classifications performed in this study. The neural network used in this study consists of 14 hidden layers. According to the neural network baseline design, the sigmoid function was applied to the activation function's initial value, the relu function was applied to the hidden layer, and optimization was performed through the Adam optimizer. In particular, the analysis of credit transaction information based on credit information of all financial institutions in www.earticle.net Korea was conducted, and there is a possibility for alleviating information asymmetry of individual credit institutions regarding risk management targets. In addition, in the case of parametric methodologies used in classical studies and most used in practice, the average classification performance for major segments was inferior to that of semi-parametric methodologies. Furthermore, the difference between these performances is up to 16 percent. This paper suggests the direction of using loan-sample data. It is foundational research for financial institutions that are using loan data for credit risk management. It is necessary to expand research focusing on semi-parametric methodologies about corporate credit information analysis.",Corporate Loan Data | Distress Risk | Machine Learning | Predicting Loan Delinquency | Sample DB Remote Analysis System,0,0,,,,undefined,

This chapter reviews a number of existing credit reporting models in the major economies, focusing on China's trust building experiences and on credit reporting in the digital age. To facilitate online trade and financial transactions, new efforts have been made to develop trust building mechanisms based on information sharing that goes beyond the traditional realm of credit scoring. The new approach attaches great importance to integrating technology with business ecosystems and serving the real economy; a broadening range of data sources; and the use of alternative data and AI methods to assess and manage risks to support key business decisions.

This article discusses artificial intelligence tools integrated into consumer mobile payment platforms that facilitate micro-lending in Kenya and alternative lending in the United States. Proponents suggest that these digital platforms are more efficient and engender less bias than conventional approaches. Evidence increasingly demonstrates, however, that these technologies may not be neutral and may, in fact, replicate or amplify bias. In this article, we examine the myths and misperceptions of financial inclusion and the limitations of the fractured regulatory environment in many countries integrating fintech in underbanked communities. We explore how financial inclusion may not only create channels for prosperity and improvement but also engineer debilitating and sometimes precarious financial circumstances for users. Regulators have taken steps towards addressing concerns, but consumer protection requires greater focus to create lasting and significant welfare reforms.

Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting, the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of such 'naive updating' when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen.

We confirm that machine-learning models are more accurate overall. We also find that they do as well as the simpler traditional model on relevant fairness criteria, where these criteria pertain to overall accuracy and error rates for population subgroups defined along protected or sensitive lines (gender, race, health status, and deprivation). We do observe some differences in the way credit-scoring models perform for different subgroups, but these manifest under a traditional modelling approach and switching to machine learning neither exacerbates nor eliminates these issues.

For this, the REINDUS program has been taken as a reference, one of the most representative instruments of industrial policy in Spain, which grants, among others, soft loans to companies with the purpose of promoting industrial development through business improvement and efficiency of the productive sectors. The period analyzed includes calls between 2009 and 2014, based on 689 SMEs with required information. Therefore, the objective of this research is focused on advancing in the specification about the usefulness of soft loans, as an instrument of industrial policy, from the perspective of productivity and efficiency, in this way, it will be possible to contribute to the development of indicators and policies for monitoring and adapting the aid programs to companies, in order to optimize the allocation of these resources and generate the desired effects in the various public policies to support the development of the business fabric in Spain. To study the improvement of productivity through the total change of the Total Factor Productivity (TFP), the Malmquist Index, initially introduced in the context of the consumer theory by Malmquist (1953), and the decompositions of Färe, Grosskopf et al. (1989, 1994) that assumed constant returns to scale using data envelopment analysis techniques, DEA (Orea and Zofío, 2017). Following this decomposition, we can calculate: (i) the productivity behavior (malmquist), (ii) the change in efficiency (effch), (iii) the technological change (tech). Färe, Grosskopf et al. (1994), provided the decomposition of efficiency into scale efficiency (out/in..scalech) and into pure efficiency change (pure.out/ in.effch), finally, following Färe, Grifell-Tatjé et al. (1997), we can obtain the marginal rate of substitution (input-biased technical change –ibtech–) and the marginal rate of product transformation (output-biased technical change –obtech–) in presence of technological change and the magnitude of technical change –matech–. To perform the necessary matching for the proposed analysis and because we are facing a quasi-experimental design, a combination of techniques is proposed, such as the analysis of Differences in Differences and the Matching by Nearby Neighbors using Mahalanobis Distance, to try to reduce the risk of bias in the estimation, since simple matching cannot account for unobservable characteristics (Pérez and Moral, 2015). To match the control and treatment groups, a model is used in which the criteria of financial capacity prevail, widely recognized by the literature on credit risk as determining factors when establishing the financing capacity of companies. The analysis of the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and its components in the study period, shows that the treated companies reduced their productivity on average, for example, the treated companies in the 2009 call shown a reduction in the TFP (malmquist) between 2012 and 2008 of 9%, while in the control companies the reduction was 7%. In the best case, call 2014, practically the same level of productivity was maintained among those treated (loss of 1% between 2013 and 2017). It was expected, therefore, that the investments made would have a positive effect on productivity, however, the results show the opposite, in fact, if technological change (tech) is observed, which implies a shift of the production frontier, presented a significant setback, it is striking, since it was the one that most contributed to the negative variation of the TFP in the analyzed period. The improvements came from positive changes in efficiency (effch), probably motivated by the reduction in wage costs after the crisis of 2007 and in line with the evolution of the labor market and the destruction of jobs in these years. Following the Färe decomposition, Grifell - Tatjé et al. (1997) we calculated the alternative directions of the bias of the inputs in the technological change. The STAF/FIAS input pair presented a bias towards the use fixed assets compared to savings in personnel expenses in the treated companies when technological change occurs, the same occurs with the treated companies in the FIAS/MATE relation, To the extent that this input is used, it generates savings in the production needed materials. In general, the impact of the program did not show a positive effect within the treated companies compared to the control companies, in fact, there were setbacks in productivity (malmquist), mainly due to the technological setback (tech-frontier shift), which was largely offset by change in efficiency (effch-catch up). This technological decrease supposes a deviation from the policy objectives on the results obtained, therefore, emphasis will have to be placed on carrying out an exhaustive analysis of possible agency conflicts within the companies, on adjustment costs not contemplated in the policy, the amount of the loans and the execution of the projects proposed in such a way that the disbursements are subject to milestones that guarantee their execution. It is proposed to design a monitoring strategy based on information technologies to facilitate and promote feedback on the objectives that allows managers to have up-to-date, quality, and robust information, recognizing that such responsibility also falls on the beneficiaries of the policy, since it is a public instrument on which companies must be accountable to society, making it a fundamental requirement to provide periodic information by the beneficiary to monitor the progress of the investments contemplated in the investment projects contributed in the time of application. Likewise, greater involvement is required from the managing entity in the realization of the business plans, mainly in the actions immediately after the disbursement, as carried out by private investment funds. This work contributes to the economic literature a detailed analysis about the impact of the soft loans of the REINDUS program on the productivity and efficiency of the companies in the period 2009 to 2014, identifying the sources of the observed change on which the policy objectives can be adjusted to maximize its effectiveness, there is no previous work in this regard. The main limitation of this work was presented in the information available for the realization of the paper. The aid Managing Administration (Dirección General de Industria y de la Pyme in 2017) refers to the Boletín Oficial del Estado where the results of the respective calls are published as the only source of information available to third parties, with the limitation that this implies. It was not until the results of the 2016 call that the rejected companies began to be published and in 2018 the scores obtained by the companies benefited exclusively, which indicates that there is a path to consolidate the institutionalization of the impact evaluation of public policies within of the Public Administration.",efficiency | impact assessment | Malmquist Index | productivity | Public economy | technical change | technical efficiency change,2,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

To satisfy this definition, we develop a framework for mitigating model bias using regularizations constructed from the SHAP values of an adversarial surrogate model. We focus on the binary classification task with a single unprivileged group and link our fairness explicability constraints to classical statistical fairness metrics.

The findings also show that efficiency has the same effect. The interaction test of bank capital and efficiency shows that efficiency encourages banks to reduce risk, including when bank capital is relatively lower. This finding is expected to have implications for the authorities to boost bank efficiency in addition to establishing several regulations related to capital.

However, it remains unclear how institutional voids impact corporate and supply chain risk and performance. This intersection will be analyzed in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a systematic literature review of 94 BoP papers published between 2004 and 2019 in peer-reviewed, English-language journals available on Scopus. Drawing upon established frameworks for examining institutional voids, supply chain risks and BoP performance, frequency, and contingency analyses are conducted. Contingencies are established to provide insights into the associations between different constructs from the selected frameworks. Findings: Supply chain risks are pervasive in the BoP discourse, especially when BoP markets are characterized by institutional voids. The frequency analysis of the constructs suggests that the key supply chain risks discussed in the BoP literature include social risk, credit risk, product market and operating uncertainties, knowledge and skill biases and decision-maker risks due to bounded rationality. The contingency analysis suggests that institutional voids are associated with supply chain risks that affect performance. Research limitations/implications: A theoretical framework aligning three research streams in the context of BoP calls for future studies to test the causality of highlighted constructs that are significantly associated. The analysis is confined to the constructs that are taken into account based on specific conceptual frameworks. Practical implications: The study provides practitioners with a framework to manage supply chain risks in BoP-related firms to enhance firm performance. Managers can use key dimensions of supply chain risk, such as the product market, the input market and operating uncertainties, to evaluate performance in the BoP context.

Consistent with this pattern, I propose a new debt reallocation channel based on informational frictions and show that the informationally closer foreign banks increase their relative exposures when the sovereign risk rises.

Most previous studies analyzed the separate effects of race and gender attributes on loan approval decisions. The analysis focuses on the stipulation of loan terms (loan amount, interest rate and maturity) among approved farm loan applications. The time period analyzed spans from 2004 until 2014 during which the government has undertaken reforms to improve delivery of loan services to its clientele of minority farmers. Thus, this study's findings could help validate the effectivity of such institutional reforms affecting Farm Service Agency (FSA) lending operations. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilizes a national direct loan origination data from the FSA of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) collected from 2004 to 2014. The analysis begins by identifying significant differences in cross-tabulations of loan terms among different racial and gender classes. Seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) regression techniques are then applied for a system of equations involving the three loan packaging components. The combined effects of the prescribed loan packaging terms are subsequently analyzed under a simulation-optimization framework. Findings: Regression results validate that indeed, relative to White American borrowers, certain minority borrowers are accommodated with lower loan amounts at higher interest rates and with shorter maturities. However, these decisions seem to be prompted by credit risk management considerations. The most compelling findings include the insignificance of all double minority labeling variables, except for the interest rate equation that even produced favorable results for Hispanic American females. Simulation-optimization results further reinforce that even when one or two unfavorable loan terms are included in the packaging, double minority borrowers end up with better profitability and liquidity positions. Practical implications: This study provides a different perspective in dealing with the controversial minority bias in lending by presenting evidence gathered from a government farm lending institution. The USDA-FSA has been sued in numerous occasions by minority borrowers. Since then, however, it has deliberately implemented institutional reforms to rectify previous errors. This study provides empirical evidence strengthening FSA's claim of its intention to improve its delivery of loan services, especially for its socially disadvantaged borrowers with double minority classification. Originality/value: This study pioneers the analysis of the double minority labeling effect on farm lending decisions. Its contributions to literature are further enhanced by its goal to validate the effectiveness of FSA institutional reforms undertaken since the early 2000s in order to improve credit access of and delivery of credit services to minority farm borrowers, especially those that belong to more than one minority classification.",Double minority | Female farmers | Loan interest rates | Loan maturity | Loan packaging terms | Racial minority,5,0,,,,undefined,

Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was conducted among the Islamic and conventional banks in Qatar, together with an analysis of archival data extracted from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the period 2009-2018. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and regression analysis. Findings: Islamic banks encounter unique types and levels of risk that are not encountered by conventional banks. In Islamic banks, risks such as those of operation and Sharia non-compliance are perceived to be higher, while in conventional banks other risks such as those of credit and insolvency are higher; other risks, for example, liquidity risk, are faced by both. RMPs are determined by understanding risk and risk management, risk identification, risk monitoring and control and credit risk analysis, but not by risk assessment and analysis. However, the RMPs of the two types of bank are not significantly different, except in the analysis of credit risk. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the debate in the literature by developing a better understanding of the dynamism of risk management in Qatari banks, which can be extended to similar contexts in the region. However, the relatively small sample size in only one country limits the possibility of generalizing the findings. The survey methodology is based on the perception of bankers rather than their actual actions and does not provide in-depth analysis for each type of risk, especially credit risk. However, using archival data, in addition to those from the survey, minimises the bias that would result from depending on one source of data. Practical implications: The study provides valuable insights into the different types and levels of risk, as well as the RMPs in Islamic and conventional banks, which can help in guiding the future development and regulation of risk management in the banking sector of Qatar and its region. Originality/value: The study helps to explain the mixed results of previous studies that compare types and levels of risk and RMPs in Islamic and conventional banks.

This selective discarding leads to bias in the parameters of the models and ultimately affects the performance of credit evaluation. One approach for handling this problem is to adopt reject inference, which is a technique that infer the status of rejected samples and incorporate the results into credit scoring models. The most popular practice of reject inference is to use a credit scoring model that is only built on accepted samples to directly predict the status of rejected samples. However, the distribution of accepted samples in online P2P lending is different from rejected samples. We propose SSL-EC3, a global semi-supervised framework that merges multiple classifiers and clustering algorithms together to make better use of the information of rejected samples. It uses multiple unsupervised models (clustering algorithms) to explore the internal relationships of all samples, and then incorporates the information into the ensemble of supervised models (classifiers) to help correct initial classification results of rejected samples. In addition, we try to use a dynamic ensemble selection (DES) to select the appropriate ensemble of classifiers for each sample to be classified.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs the system generalized method of moments estimator to avoid the dynamic panel bias and endogeneity issues. Different indices of economic growth are used in each model in order to find the most significant proxy of the economic cycle that influences problem loans. The analysis is carried out using a sample of 49 developed countries covering a 16-year period (2000–2015). Findings: The overall empirical results highlight that the development of industrial sectors and exports are the main drivers of loan performance in high-income countries. The findings specifically recommend adopting an expansionary fiscal policy to boost per capita income and potential productivity for the safety of the banking system. Practical implications: The findings have direct practical applicability for stabilizing the financial system. The study recommends the government to increase the productivity of export-oriented industries in order to boost employment and increase the payment obligations of individuals and business firms. More importantly, it highlights the essentiality of perfect economic policy to control default risks. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study that compares the relative effect of three alternative proxies of the economic cycle on credit risk and identifies the most significant proxy. The current study also empirically shows that industrial development could be one of the crucial factors to improve financial health in developed countries.",Financial stability | Industrial policy | National expenditure | Non-performing loan | Per capita income | Trade openness,13,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Lately, the use of ADM systems across various fields, ranging from public to private, from criminal justice to credit scoring, has given rise to concerns about the negative consequences that data-driven technologies have in reinforcing and reinterpreting existing societal biases. This development has led to growing demand for ethical AI, often perceived to require human control over automation. By engaging in discussions of human-computer interaction and in post-structural policy analysis, I examine EU policy proposals to address the problematizations of AI through human oversight. I argue that the relevant policy documents do not reflect the results of earlier research which have undeniably demonstrated the shortcomings of human control over automation, which in turn leads to the reproduction of the harmful dichotomy of human versus machine in EU policy. Despite its shortcomings, the emphasis on human oversight reflects broader fears surrounding loss of control, framed as ethical concerns around digital technologies.

Most credit scoring models address this problem by deleting the missing instances from the dataset or imputing missing values with the mean, mode, or regression values. However, these methods often result in a significant loss of information or a bias. We proposed a novel method called BNII to impute missing values, which can be helpful for intelligent credit scoring systems. The proposed BNII algorithm consisted of two stages: the preparatory stage and the imputation stage. In the first stage, a Bayesian network with all of the attributes in the original dataset was constructed from the complete dataset so that both the network structure that implied the dependencies between variables and the parameters at each variable's conditional distributions could be learned. In the second stage, multivariables with missing values were iteratively imputed using Bayesian network models from the first stage. The algorithm was found to be monotonically convergent. The most significant advantages of the method include, it exploits the inherent probability-dependent relationship between variables, but without a specific probability distribution hypothesis, and it is suitable for multivariate missing cases. Three datasets were used for experiments: one was the real dataset from a famous P2P financial company in China, and the other two were benchmark datasets provided by UCI. The experimental results showed that BNII performed significantly better than the other well-known imputation techniques. This suggested that the proposed method can be used to improve the performance of a credit scoring system and to be extended to other expert and intelligent systems.",Bayesian network | Credit scoring | Data mining | Data missing,23,0,,,NSFC,2018GK1020,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The results show that proper variable discretization and cost-sensitive logistic regression with the best class weights can reduce the model bias and/or variance. From the perspective of the algorithm, cost-sensitive logistic regression is beneficial for increasing the value of predictors even if they are not in their optimized forms while maintaining monotonicity. From the perspective of predictors, the variable discretization performs better than cost-sensitive logistic regression, provides more reasonable coefficient estimates for predictors which have nonlinear relationships against their empirical logit, and is robust to penalty weights on misclassifications of events and non-events determined by their apriori proportions.",Class imbalance | cost-sensitive logistic regression | credit scoring | discrimination ability | variable discretization,12,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In the “Creditworthiness” section on page 218, two direct quotes from the article by Fourcade and Healy () were not correctly attributed. The correct text should be the following: Fourcade and Healy's () recent work offer a sophisticated analysis of how markets “see” people into different categories in terms of their “creditworthiness”. In earlier times, Fourcade and Healy inform us that assessing the creditworthiness of individuals was the work of bank or retail finance officers who met potential clients in person and evaluated them based on their physical appearance, their demeanor, and even local gossip. Over time, the process became more standardized and more quantitative. By the 1950s, credit reporting companies had already begun to make probabilistic forecasts based on statistical analyses of longitudinal population data. In the 1970s, credit scoring—that is, “the numerical evaluation of a person's reliability and integrity based on his or her individual credit file”—was formally established as an objective way of appraising somebody's creditworthiness (p. 563). Fourcade and Healy note that these developments are believed to have brought a degree of fairness to the credit markets because the new system focused on individual traits rather than group credit histories. Though there is evidence that these new techniques have increased access to the financial system across the board, there are still stratifying effects of differential lending based on classification. Inequities in the market are “less a matter of access to credit and abandonment and more a matter of the differential interest rates that borrowers pay” (Langley, 2009, p. 168). As Fourcade and Healy explain, “scoring has expanded the reach of the market while opening the door to new forms of classification with powerful stratifying effects” (p. 564). The expansion in the supply of subprime credit market—that is, the market that provides credit to people with poor credit histories and little in down payments—reflects this. Citizens who do not qualify for conventional loans can still access credit if they were willing to pay a higher interest rate (Fligstein and Goldstein, 2010).

For home purchases, lenders generally require an independent appraisal, which, in addition to a home’s sales price, is used to calculate a value for the underlying collateral. A number of empirical studies have shown that property appraisals tend to be biased upwards, and over 90 percent of the time, either confirm or exceed the associated contract price. Our data suggest that appraisal bias is particularly pervasive in rural areas where over 25 percent of rural properties are appraised at more than five percent above contract price.

Not surprisingly, these decisions limit fairness frameworks' ability to capture a variety of harms caused by systems. We characterize fairness limitations using concepts from requirements engineering and from social sciences. We show that the focus on algorithms' inputs and outputs misses harms that arise from systems interacting with the world; that the focus on bias and discrimination omits broader harms on populations and their environments; and that relying on service providers excludes scenarios where they are not cooperative or intentionally adversarial. We propose Protective Optimization Technologies (POTs). POTs, provide means for affected parties to address the negative impacts of systems in the environment, expanding avenues for political contestation. POTs intervene from outside the system, do not require service providers to cooperate, and can serve to correct, shift, or expose harms that systems impose on populations and their environments. We illustrate the potential and limitations of POTs in two case studies: countering road congestion caused by traffic-beating applications, and recalibrating credit scoring for loan applicants.",Fairness and Accountability | Protective Optimization Technologies,26,1,repositoryam,Green,H2020,653497,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

It concludes that current practice is inadequate and needs to change.A review is carried out of papers on not only this subject but also (to collect ideas rather than automatically apply them to pensions solvency valuations) pensions and insurance accounting and regulation.Current practice is ""scheme-specific funding""which permits discretion on choice of discount rates and other assumptions; the paper is concerned that this can lead to bias, and that trends in a scheme's solvency can be obscured by changing assumptions. This also leads to the funding ratio communicated to scheme members having little meaning.The paper suggests that regulators should require a valuation that is based on sound principles, objective, fair, neutral, transparent and feasible. A prescribed methodology would replace discretion.It concludes that the benefits to be valued are those arising on discontinuance of the scheme, without allowing for future salary-related benefit increases, which are felt to no longer be a constructive obligation of employers.The valuation should, it is suggested, use market values of assets, which is largely current practice.Liabilities should reflect the trustees fulfilling their liabilities, rather than transferring them to an insurer (which may introduce artificialities).The discount rate should follow the ""matching""approach, being a market-consistent risk-free rate: this is consistent with several papers to the profession in recent years. It avoids the problems of the ""budgeting""approach, where the discount rate is based on the expected return on assets - this can be used to help set contribution levels but is not suitable for determining the value of liabilities, which depends on salary, service, longevity, etc and (very largely) not on the assets held. In principle, the liability value can be adjusted for illiquidity. Credit risk of the employer should not be allowed for.Liabilities should reflect the (probability-weighted) expected value of future cash flows and should not be increased by prudent margins or risk margins (which would lead to a non-neutral figure). Risk disclosures are needed to understand and manage risks.The resulting funding ratio is a consistent measure, to be disclosed to members, which can be used to manage the scheme, and by regulators as the basis for requiring action. Scheme-specific management using data such as the employer covenant means that immediate action to ensure 100% solvency on the proposed basis would not necessarily be appropriate.The author encourages the profession to advise TPR on the above lines.",Defined benefit schemes | Discount rates | Funding | Pension regulation | Valuation methods,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

First, we propose a self-learning framework for reject inference. The framework is geared toward real-world credit scoring requirements through considering distinct training regimes for labeling and model training. Second, we introduce a new measure to assess the effectiveness of reject inference strategies. Our measure leverages domain knowledge to avoid artificial labeling of rejected cases during evaluation. We demonstrate this approach to offer a robust and operational assessment of reject inference.

When a financial institution wants to create a credit scoring model for all applicants, the institution only has the known good/bad loan outcome for the accepted applicants; this causes an inherent bias in the model. Reject inference is the process of inferring a good/bad loan outcome to the applicants that were rejected for a loan so that the updated credit scoring model will be representative of all loan applicants, accepted and rejected. This paper presents an empirical reject inference technique using a Bayesian network. The proposed method has an advantage over traditional reject inference methods since there is no functional form that will be estimated with the accepted applicants' data and extrapolated to the rejected applicants to infer their good/bad loan outcome status.",Bayesian networks | Credit scoring | Predictive accuracy | Reject inference,22,0,,,,undefined,

Although this issue has been examined before, a comprehensive study on this topic is still lacking. This literature review aims to identify studies on Big Data in relation to discrimination in order to (1) understand the causes and consequences of discrimination in data mining, (2) identify barriers to fair data-mining and (3) explore potential solutions to this problem. Methods: Six databases were systematically searched (between 2010 and 2017): PsychINDEX, SocIndex, PhilPapers, Cinhal, Pubmed and Web of Science. Results: Most of the articles addressed the potential risk of discrimination of data mining technologies in numerous aspects of daily life (e.g. employment, marketing, credit scoring). The majority of the papers focused on instances of discrimination related to historically vulnerable categories, while others expressed the concern that scoring systems and predictive analytics might introduce new forms of discrimination in sectors like insurance and healthcare. Discriminatory consequences of data mining were mainly attributed to human bias and shortcomings of the law; therefore suggested solutions included comprehensive auditing strategies, implementation of data protection legislation and transparency enhancing strategies. Some publications also highlighted positive applications of Big Data technologies. Conclusion: This systematic review primarily highlights the need for additional empirical research to assess how discriminatory practices are both voluntarily and accidentally emerging from the increasing use of data analytics in our daily life. Moreover, since the majority of papers focused on the negative discriminative consequences of Big Data, more research is needed on the potential positive uses of Big Data with regards to social disparity.",Big Data | Data analytics | Disparity | Ethics | Inequality | Unfair discrimination,68,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,SNF,407540_167211,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung

LuPe allows to optimize the choice of the applied model for subgroups of the population or individuals, thereby personalizing the model choice to best fit users' profiles, which improves fairness. LuPe further captures data to explain the choices made and the results of the model. We showcase how such data enable users to understand the system performance they can expect.

Logistic regression, which is widely used to estimate the probability of default, PD, often suffers from the problem of separation when the event of interest is rare and consequently poor predictive performance of the minority class in small samples. A common solution is to discard majority class examples, to duplicate minority class examples or to use a combination of both to balance the data. These methods may overfit data. It is unclear how penalized regression models such as Firth's estimator, which reduces bias and mean-square error relative to classical logistic regression, performs in modelling PD.

We emphasize the effect of events per variable for developing an accurate model—an often neglected concept in PD-modelling.

This question is pertinent given the higher levels of perceived riskiness of lending to small business operators owing to their opacity. Design/methodology/approach: The study accommodates panel bias by using system generalised method of moments (GMM) estimators on micro-level data from 2004 to 2014. Findings: Study findings indicate that lending to small businesses by MFIs does not affect credit and insolvency risk in these institutions. However, using disaggregated data, there is evidence that lending to small businesses by cooperatives significantly reduces their insolvency risk exposure. Conversely, lending to small business by micro-banks, cooperatives, non-bank financial institutions and non-governmental organizations does not significantly affect their risk exposure. Practical implications: These findings imply that the technologies that have been used by MFIs in lending to small enterprises have helped them mitigate the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard.

Generalized additive models (GAM) provide a convenient way to overcome the restriction to purely linear predictors. Therefore, the covariates may be included as flexible nonlinear or spatial functions to avoid potential bias arising from misspecification. Single index models, on the other hand, utilize flexible specifications of the response function and therefore avoid the deteriorating impact of a misspecified response function. However, such single index models are usually restricted to a linear predictor and aim to compensate for potential nonlinear structures only via the estimated response function. We will show that this is insufficient in many cases and present a solution by combining a flexible approach for response function estimation using monotonic P-splines with additive predictors as in GAMs. Our approach is based on maximum likelihood estimation and also allows us to provide confidence intervals of the estimated effects.

The dependence of a TPM on the economic cycle is achieved by linking the bias and inertia to macroeconomic variables using regression modeling techniques. A TPM reconstruction algorithm (for given values of the bias and inertia parameters) is used, together with exogenous stressed future values for the macroeconomic factors, to produce stressed projections of portfolio default rates (DRs). We compare, out-of-sample and using a data set from Moody's Credit Risk Calculator, results using this new methodology with results using two other competing methodologies. The out-of-sample period is chosen to coincide with the 2008 financial crisis, to resemble a stressed period; this is an appropriate and innovative backtesting exercise, given that the methods discussed here are stress-testing methods.We find that, overall, the method we propose outperforms the other two competing methods.

It utilizes statistical techniques along with debtor data such as loan application or credit bureau information to measure debtor’s creditworthiness. When compared with the traditional credit evaluation process, credit scoring has shown less bias, faster speed, and consistent measurement of creditworthiness. For this reason, the National Credit Bureau of Thailand (NCB) has developed the NCB Score, based on credit behavior information collected from its members’ financial institutions, which normally issue a wide variety of credit products. However, problems can arise when this NCB score is applied to a smaller bank that usually offers a few specific types of loans. As a result, the score’s predictive power may deteriorate. In this paper, the impact of baseline population difference on the predictive power of a credit score was studied by separating proprietary data from NCB into two groups. One group represents those who originate personal loans in the seventh month of the study period, and the other group represents those who originate mortgage loans in the seventh month of the study period.

However, in practice these models are normally built on a sample of accepted applicants and fail to consider the remaining rejected applicants. This may cause a sample bias which is an important statistical issue, especially in the online lending situation where a large proportion of requests are rejected. Reject inference is a method for inferring how rejected applicants would have behaved if they had been granted and incorporating this information in rebuilding a more accurate credit scoring system. Due to the good performances of SVM models in this area, this paper proposes a new approach based on the state-of-the-art kernel-free fuzzy quadratic surface SVM model. It is worth pointing out that our method not only performs very well in classification as some latest works, but also handles some big issues in the classical SVM models, such as searching proper kernel functions and solving complex models. Besides, this paper is the first one to eliminate the bad effect of outliers in credit scoring. Moreover, we use two real-world loan data sets to compare our method with some benchmark methods. Particularly, one of the data set is very valuable for the study of reject inference, because the outcomes of rejected applicants are partially known.

This bias is exacerbated when mortgages are originated with longer terms, at higher LTV ratios, or when sellers possess stronger bargaining power. Furthermore, this bias is larger under aggressive lending products, e.g. interest-only loans and mortgages allowing negative amortization. Our simulation results suggest that many mortgages originated at the peak of the housing bubble are, in fact, “under water” at origination.

When the selection mechanism leads to many censored observations, few data are available for the estimation of the outcome equation parameters, giving rise to computational difficulties. In this context, the main reference is Greene (2008) who extends the results obtained by Manski and Lerman (1977), and develops an estimator which requires the knowledge of the true proportion of occurrences in the outcome equation. We develop a method that exploits the advantages of response-based sampling schemes in the context of binary response models with a sample selection, relaxing this assumption. Estimation is based on a weighted version of Heckman’s likelihood, where the weights take into account the sampling design.

It aims to understand if banks portray credit risk-related information in graphs accurately and whether these graphs provide incremental, rather than replicative, information. It also investigates whether credit risk-related graphs provide a fair representation of risk performance or a more favourable impression than is warranted. Design/methodology/approach - A graphical accuracy index was constructed. Incremental information was measured. A multi-level linear model investigated whether credit risk affects the quantity and quality of graphical credit risk disclosure. Findings - Banks used credit risk graphs to provide incremental information. They were also selective, with riskier banks less likely to use risk graphs. Banks were accurate in their graphical reporting, particularly those with high levels of credit risk. These findings can be explained within an impression management perspective taking human cognitive biases into account. Preparers of risk graphs seem to prefer selective omission over obfuscation via inaccuracy. This probably reflects the fact that individuals, and by implication annual report's users, generally judge the provision of inaccurate information more harshly than the omission of unfavourable information. Research limitations/implications - This study provides theoretical insights by pointing out the limitations of a purely economics-based agency theory approach to impression management. Practical implications - The study suggests annual reports' readers need to be careful about subtle forms of impression management, such as those exploiting their cognitive bias. Regulatory and professional bodies should develop guidelines to ensure neutral and comparable graphical disclosure. Originality/value - This study provides a substantive alternative to the predominant economic perspective on impression management in corporate reporting, by incorporating a psychological perspective taking human cognitive biases into account.",Banks | Corporate reports | Credit risk graphs | Impression management | Incremental information | Omission strategy,12,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

We perform a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters on the resulting credit risk measures as well as the changes in their relationship to the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) parameter; this controls the degree of market departure from fair value, illustrating an application of an important model validation procedure. We also perform an exercise in which we calibrate the model to historical equity prices and project credit losses on both baseline and stressed conditions for bubble and nonbubble parameter estimate settings. Through the estimation of the CEV model parameters from a long time series, we find statistically significant evidence that the historical Standard & Poor's index exhibits only mild bubble behavior, but this translates into underestimation of potential extreme credit losses according to standard measures by an order of magnitude. However, while there is still some underestimation of unexpected credit losses under the EHPCL measure, it is of a much lower severity than in the case of traditional measures: it is on the order of 1.5% in the former, compared with tenfold in the latter. However, the degree of relative underestimation of risk due to asset price bubbles is significantly attenuated under stressed parameter settings in our model. The implication of these findings is that risk managers should be wary of measuring tail credit losses according to standard credit risk measures. Alternative measures, such as the EHPCL, should be considered, including benchmarking to stress testing generated credit losses.",Asset price bubbles | Credit risk | Financial crisis | Model risk | Model validation | Sensitivity analysis | Stress testing,2,0,,,,undefined,

We empirically examine the approach on a panel data set from a German credit bureau, where we also study dynamic dependencies such as prior rating migrations and defaults.",Credit scoring | Default probability prediction | Estimation risk premium,0,0,,,,undefined,

An innovation to improve on the flawed but widespread use of loan-to-value measures, is to estimate difficult-to-observe variations in loan quality and access to refinancing, and shifts in lenders' forbearance policy, by common latent variables in a system of equations for arrears and repossessions. We introduce, for the first time in the literature, a theory-justified estimate of the proportion of mortgages in negative equity as a key driver of aggregate repossessions and arrears. This is based on an average debt-equity ratio, corrected for regional deviations, and uses a functional form for the distribution of the debt-equity ratio checked on Irish micro-data from the Bank of Ireland, and Bank of England snapshots of negative equity. We systematically address serious measurement bias in the 'months-in-arrears' measures, neglected in previous UK studies. Highly significant effects on aggregate rates of repossessions and arrears are found for the aggregate debt-service ratio, the proportion of mortgages in negative equity and the unemployment rate. Economic forecast scenarios to 2020 highlight risks faced by the UK and its mortgage lenders, illustrating the usefulness of the approach for bank stress-testing.

A credit scoring model makes loaning process faster. However, it is nearly unfeasible to analyze this large amount of data; the feature selection techniques have been used to address this issue. Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. Unlike the existing feature selection techniques that cause bias using distinct statistical properties of data for feature evaluation, the feature selection based on rank aggregation is more robust, thus reducing this bias. Over the past years, rank aggregation has emerged as an important tool. Despite its numerous advantages, rank aggregation may be a deep problem. In fact, rankings provided by the different filters may be in many cases incomplete and similar features may be given disjoint ranking. We first consider the rank aggregation problem as an optimization problem, in which we aim to find an optimal list that approximates all the aggregated lists. Then we concentrate on the problem of disjoint ranking; subsequently, we perform a new algorithm that eliminate disjoint ranking for similar features and remove the features that bring less information to the target concept. The performance of our approach was tested using four credit datasets and compared to three individual filters and four well-known aggregation techniques. The result indicates that the proposed technique is more robust across a wide range of classifiers and has higher accuracy than other traditional feature selection techniques.",Aggregation | Feature selection | Filter | Genetic algorithm,6,0,,,,undefined,

Proving that the transaction rendered the firm insolvent may allow debtors (or their proxies) to claw back transfers made to former shareholders and others as part of the transaction. Courts have recently questioned the robustness of the solvency evidence traditionally provided in such cases, claiming that traditional expert analyses (e.g., a discounted flow analysis) may suffer from hindsight (and other forms of) bias, and thus not reflect an accurate view of the firm's insolvency prospects at the time of the challenged transfers. To address the issue, courts have recently suggested that experts should consider market evidence, such as the firm's stock, bond, or credit default swap prices at the time of the challenged transaction. We review market-evidence- based approaches for determination of solvency in fraudulent conveyance cases. Methodology/approach - We compare different methods of solvency determination that rely on market data. We discuss the pros and cons of these methods and illustrate the use of credit default swap spreads with a numerical example. Finally, we highlight the limitations of these methods. Findings - If securities trade in efficient markets in which security prices quickly impound all available information, then such security prices provide an objective assessment of investors' views of the firm's future insolvency prospects at the time of challenged transfer, given contemporaneously available information. As we explain, using market data to analyze fraudulent conveyance claims or assess a firm's solvency prospects is not as straightforward as some courts argue. To do so, an expert must first pick a particular credit risk model from a host of choices which links the market evidence (or security price) to the likelihood of future default. Then, to implement his chosen model, the expert must estimate various parameter input values at the time of the alleged fraudulent transfer. In this connection, it is important to note that each credit risk model rests on particular assumptions, and there are typically several ways in which a model's key parameters may be empirically estimated. Such choices critically affect any conclusion about a firm's future default prospects as of the date of an alleged fraudulent conveyance. Practical implications - Simply using market evidence does not necessarily eliminate the question of bias in any analysis. The reliability of a plaintiff's claims regarding fraudulent conveyance will depend on the reasonableness of the analysis used to tie the observed market evidence at the time of the alleged fraudulent transfer to default prospects of the firm. Originality/value - There is a large body of literature in financial economics that examines the relationship between market data and the prospects of a firm's future default. However, there is surprisingly little research tying that literature to the analysis of fraudulent conveyance claims. Our paper, in part, attempts to do so. We show that while market- based methods use the information contained in market prices, this information must be supplemented with assumptions and the conclusions of these methods critically depend on the assumption made.",Fraudulent conveyance claims | Leveraged buyout (LBO) | Solvency determination,0,0,,,,undefined,

In addition, we discuss such key credit risk determinants as borrower characteristics, terms of the mortgage contract, mortgage characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions. Finally, we conclude the discussion with possible research questions.",Credit risk | Default | Mortgage | Sample selection bias,1,0,,,,undefined,

More specifically, we use wrapper feature selection methods to identify features that contain the most relevant information to distinguish good loan applicants from bad loan applicants. Wrapper feature selection approaches are widely used to select a small subset of relevant features from a dataset. However, wrappers suffer from the fact that they only use a single classifier in the evaluation process and each classifier is of a different nature and will have its own biases. Hence, this paper investigates the effects of using different classifiers for wrapper feature selection. A new ensemble method for feature selection is then proposed and evaluated on four credit datasets, and results illustrate that combining classifiers improves the performance of scoring models.",Credit scoring | Feature selection | Wrapper,0,0,,,,undefined,

This is at odds with theory, which assigns a critical role to unemployment in the decision to stop payment on a mortgage. We help reconcile this divergence by employing a novel empirical strategy involving simulated unemployment histories to measure the severity of attenuation bias in loan-level estimations of default risk due to a borrower becoming unemployed. Attenuation bias results because individual data on unemployment status is unobserved, requiring that a market-wide unemployment rate be used as a proxy. Attenuation is extreme, with our results suggesting that the use of an aggregate unemployment rate in lieu of actual borrower unemployment status results in default risk from a borrower becoming unemployed being underestimated by a factor more than 100. In addition, our analysis indicates that adding the unemployment rate as a proxy for the missing borrower-specific unemployment indicator does not improve the accuracy of the estimated model over the specification without the proxy variable included. Hence, aggregate portfolio-level risk estimates for mortgage guarantors such as FHA also are not improved.

The documented bias in credit ratings confronts financial markets with uncertainties regarding their relevance. Should investors continue to rely on credit ratings in their portfolio allocation decisions? Should banks use ratings to evaluate credit risk of collateral? Should corporate managers consider the impact on ratings when formulating financial policies? This study addresses one aspect of this broad issue and evaluates if and how rating biases affect corporate bond pricing and yield spreads. If bonds receive better (worse) ratings than justified and bond markets rely on these biased ratings, then bonds would be over (under) priced and thus trade at smaller (larger) yield spreads. Using a large sample of initial bond ratings from Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch between 1995 and 2010, this study discovered that credit ratings continue to elicit informational value beyond financial and issue-related characteristics.

Objectives: This study is intended to describe three major threats to the validity of the SCT not yet considered in prior research and to illustrate the severity of these threats. Methods: We conducted a review of SCT reports available through the Web of Science database. Additionally, we reanalysed scores from a previously published SCT administration to explore issues related to standard SCT scoring practice. Results: Firstly, the predominant method for aggregate and partial credit scoring of SCTs introduces logical inconsistencies in the scoring key. Secondly, our literature review shows that SCT reliability studies have generally ignored inter-panel, inter-panellist and test-retest measurement error. Instead, studies have focused on observed levels of coefficient alpha, which is neither an informative index of internal structure nor a comprehensive index of reliability for SCT scores. As such, claims that SCT scores show acceptable reliability are premature. Finally, SCT criteria for item inclusion, in concert with a statistical artefact of the SCT format, cause anchors at the extremes of the scale to have less expected credit than anchors near or at the midpoint. Consequently, SCT scores are likely to reflect construct-irrelevant differences in examinees' response styles. This makes the test susceptible to bias against candidates who endorse extreme scale anchors more readily; it also makes two construct-irrelevant test taking strategies extremely effective. In our reanalysis, we found that examinees could drastically increase their scores by never endorsing extreme scale points. Furthermore, examinees who simply endorsed the scale midpoint for every item would still have outperformed most examinees who used the scale as it is intended. Conclusions: Given the severity of these threats, we conclude that aggregate scoring of SCTs cannot be recommended. Recommendations for revisions of SCT methodology are discussed. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,60,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This assessment is based on customers' repayment performance over a given fixed period. Often the outcome period and fixed performance period are arbitrarily selected, causing instability in making predictions. Behavioural scoring has failed to receive the same attention from researchers as application scoring. The bias for application scoring research can be attributed, in part, to the large volume of data required for behavioural scoring studies. Furthermore, the commercial sensitivities associated with such a large pool of customer data often prohibits the publication of work in this area. This paper focuses on behavioural scoring and evaluates the contrasting effects of altering the performance period and outcome period using 7-years worth of data from the Irish market. The results of this work indicate that a 12-month performance period yields an easier prediction task when compared with other historical payment periods of varying lengths. This article also quantifies differences in the classification performance of logistic regression arising from different outcome periods length. Our findings show that the performance of a logistic regression classifier degrades significantly when the outcome window is extended beyond 6-month. Finally we consider different approaches to how the concept of default is defined. Typically whether the customer is identified as a default risk or not is set based on either (i) whether the account is in default at the end of the outcome period or (ii) at any time during the outcome period.

240,2-s2.0-84936792146,,,,Report to Congress under Section 319 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003,ch,Book Chapter,,,,,,,,,,2013-01-01,2013,Credit Report Accuracy: A National Study of Primary Participants in the Scoring and Reporting Process,,21100398549,,Book,,,,1-277,"Pursuant to Section 319 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (""FACT Act""), the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") submits its fifth interim report on a national study of credit report accuracy. Section 319 of the FACT Act requires the FTC to conduct a study of the accuracy and completeness of consumer credit reports. The FTC contracted a research team to conduct two pilot studies and collect the data for the main study described in this report. The research team included members from the University of Missouri, St. Louis (UMSL), the University of Arizona, and the Fair Isaac Corporation. The contractor produced statistical tabulations of errors at the case (consumer) level, individual credit report level, and credit report item level. At the conclusion of the study, the contractor provided data in a de-identified format as well as an in- depth report summarizing the findings; the contractor's report is included as Appendix D. Economists in the Bureau of Economics at the FTC independently analyzed the data and drafted this report. This study of credit report accuracy was the first national study designed to engage all the primary groups that participate in the credit reporting and scoring process: consumers, lenders/data furnishers, the Fair Isaac Corporation (""FICO""), and the national credit reporting agencies (""CRAs""). In brief, the study design called for consumers to be randomly selected from the population of interest (consumers with credit histories at the three national CRAs). Ultimately, 1,001 study participants reviewed 2,968 credit reports (roughly three per participant) with a study associate who helped them identify potential errors. Study participants were encouraged to use the Fair Credit Reporting Act (""FCRA"") dispute process to challenge potential errors that might have a material effect on the participant's creditstanding (i.e., potentially change the credit score associated with that credit report). When a consumer identified and disputed an error on a credit report, the study associate informed FICO of the disputed items, and FICO generated a provisional FICO score for the report under the assumption that all consumer allegations were correct. After the completion of the FCRA dispute process, study participants were provided with new credit reports and credit scores. Using the provisional FICO score, the new credit reports and credit scores, and the original credit reports and credit scores, we are able to determine the impact on the consumer's credit score from both potential and confirmed material errors. Consumers were recruited to participate through a mailed invitation and an online registration process. The response rate was low (3.9%) relative to standard surveys, possibly due to the private and personal nature of the information analyzed (credit reports). However, the response rate is consistent with the FTC pilot studies and other studies of this issue (e.g., the PERC study discussed below). The solicitation process was designed to recruit a participant sample that is representative of the credit scores of the population of interest. Because consumers voluntarily participated in a study that required a moderate time commitment and reviewed personal data, there is the chance that the participant sample is not entirely representative of consumers with credit reports. Various credit and non-credit data on non-respondents were collected to evaluate this issue. Upon comparing participants and non-participants on multiple dimensions, we found participants to be similar to non-participants in the majority of factors that might impact credit scores. To the extent that significant differences arise, we expect the potential biases to be modest. For the purposes of this study, we define a =potential error' as an alleged inaccuracy identified by the participants with the help of the study associate. Credit reports contain a great deal of information, including identifying personal information, credit account information, public records, collections accounts, and inquiries. Lenders often use the credit score associated with a credit report to assess the credit risk of a particular consumer. Therefore, we define a =potentially material error' as an alleged inaccuracy in information that is commonly used to generate credit scores. Information used to generate credit scores include the number of collections accounts, the number of inquiries (hard pulls on a credit file), the number of negative items such as late or missed payments, and other factors. An alleged error is considered potentially material prior to the dispute process simply by its nature as an item used to generate credit scores. Through the dispute process and FICO rescoring analysis, we determine the extent to which consumer credit reports contained confirmed material errors. We define a =confirmed material error' in several ways, though all rely on a confirmed error being determined as a result of the FCRA dispute process. After the disputes were filed and completed, the study associate drew new credit reports for the consumer and analyzed whether there were changes to the report in response to the dispute. If there were no changes to the report, the original FICO score is relevant for our calculations and if all the alleged inaccurate items were modified by the CRA, the provisional FICO rescore is the relevant credit score. If only some of the disputed items were changed, the modified report was sent to a FICO analyst for a second rescoring to assess the impact of the modifications. The relevant FICO score at the conclusion of the dispute and rescoring process is then compared to the original FICO score to determine how the credit report inaccuracies affected the consumer credit score. The most conservative definition of a confirmed error is the situation where the consumer disputes an item on a credit report, instructs the CRA on how to modify the report, and the CRA agrees with every element of the consumer dispute and follows all of the consumer's instructions. There are a number of reasons, however, why a CRA may make changes to a credit report that differ from the consumer's instructions. For example, a consumer may dispute an account balance and instruct the CRA to change the balance to a specific amount (i.e., the consumer alleges what is incorrect and what action by the CRA would set it right). If the CRA cannot confirm the existence of the account with the data furnisher, the account is removed from the consumer's credit report; in this case the outcome is not what the consumer requested. In addition, a consumer may dispute multiple items on a credit report as inaccurate and the CRA may only modify a subset of the disputed items, thus suggesting that the consumer was correct regarding some of the inaccuracies on the report but not all. The nature of the types of errors and the possible actions by CRAs makes strictly defining a =confirmed error' somewhat complicated. Thus, a more expansive definition of a consumer with a confirmed error is one where a consumer disputes at least one item with a CRA and the CRA makes at least one modification to that credit report in response to the dispute. Note that this expansive definition would include consumers who are not entirely satisfied with the outcome of the dispute because some of their requested changes were not made by the CRA(s). In addition, there are some consumers who file disputes and yet the CRA makes no modification to their report. For the purpose of the analysis within this report, these consumers are not defined as having a confirmed material error. It is important to note that these consumers with alleged potentially material errors that are not confirmed through the FCRA dispute process may still have inaccurate items on their credit reports; however, we are unable to verify the inaccuracy within the design of this study. In a separate section, we report the hypothetical impact on credit score if every alleged inaccuracy disputed by consumers was modified by the relevant CRA (i.e., assuming every alleged potentially material error that the consumer disputed was in fact a =confirmed error.') There is no established rule or threshold for classifying the significance of a credit score change as minor or major because the impact of a change in score is dependent on the current score. That is, a 25 point change in FICO score that keeps the consumer in a particular credit risk category may not have a large impact on the person's likelihood of receiving credit. On the other hand, a one-point change in credit score that moves a consumer from one risk tier to the next may have a large impact on the consumer's access to credit or the products and rates the consumer is able to secure. Below we report the frequency of reports and consumers that have any change in score, changes in score more than 10 points, more than 25 points, and changes in score that move a consumer from one credit risk tier to another. There are a number of advantages to the methodology of this study relative to previous work on the issue of accuracy. One important feature is our ability to assess accuracy at both the credit report level and the consumer level, because each consumer reviews all available credit reports. Because the consumer is the primary unit of analysis, we are able to provide reliable estimates of the proportion of American consumers who would encounter material errors across their three credit reports. Considering that lenders often use a composite of the consumer's three reports and scores in making a credit decision, the impact of material errors on consumers is a focal point of the study. We cannot provide information on the extent to which there may be errors on consumer credit reports that positively impact a consumer's credit score.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. The goal of fairness-aware classifiers is to classify data while taking into account the potential issues of fairness, discrimination, neutrality, and/or independence. In this paper, after reviewing fairness-aware classification methods, we focus on one such method, Calders and Verwer's two-naive-Bayes method. This method has been shown superior to the other classifiers in terms of fairness, which is formalized as the statistical independence between a class and a sensitive feature. However, the cause of the superiority is unclear, because it utilizes a somewhat heuristic post-processing technique rather than an explicitly formalized model. We clarify the cause by comparing this method with an alternative naive Bayes classifier, which is modified by a modeling technique called 'hypothetical fair-factorization.' This investigation reveals the theoretical background of the two-naive-Bayes method and its connections with other methods. Based on these findings, we develop another naive Bayes method with an 'actual fair-factorization technique' and empirically show that this new method can achieve an equal level of fairness as that of the two-naive-Bayes classifier. © 2013 IEEE.",Discrimination-aware data mining | Fairness-aware data mining | Naive Bayes | Privacy,10,0,repositoryam,Green,JSPS,23240043,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

Classification models are one of the most widely used groups of data mining approaches that greatly help decision makers and managers to reduce their credit risk of granting credits to customers instead of intuitive experience or portfolio management. Accuracy is one of the most important criteria in order to choose a credit-scoring model; and hence, the researches directed at improving upon the effectiveness of credit scoring models have never been stopped. In this article, a hybrid binary classification model, namely FMLP, is proposed for credit scoring, based on the basic concepts of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the proposed model, instead of crisp weights and biases, used in traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), fuzzy numbers are used in order to better model of the uncertainties and complexities in financial data sets. Empirical results of three well-known benchmark credit data sets indicate that hybrid proposed model outperforms its component and also other those classification models such as support vector machines (SVMs), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed model can be an appropriate alternative tool for financial binary classification problems, especially in high uncertainty conditions. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Artificial neural networks (ANNs) | Classification | Credit scoring | Fuzzy logic and fuzzy models | Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs),16,0,,,,undefined,

This methodology is implemented and tested in a wide variety of market conditions, and across a large set of sectors and issuers, from the highest credit quality to highly distressed ones.

Several statistical and econometric methods were used to the test the hypotheses. Findings – Banks in Bahrain are found to have a clear understanding of risk and risk management, and have efficient risk identification, risk assessment analysis, risk monitoring, credit risk analysis and risk management practices. In addition, credit, liquidity and operational risk are found to be the most important risks facing both conventional and Islamic banks. Furthermore, the risk management practices are determined by the extent to which managers understand risk and risk management, efficient risk identification, risk assessment analysis, risk monitoring and credit risk analysis.

The levels of risks faced by Islamic banks are found to be significantly higher than those faced by conventional banks. Similarly, country, liquidity, and operational, residual, and settlement risks are found to be higher in Islamic banks than in conventional banks. Research limitations/implications – The results may have been influenced by the current economic global crisis. Although the response rate is very high, there is no evidence of non-response bias, and there is high internal consistency within the responses. The reliance on survey methodology introduces the possibility that respondents expressed their beliefs and did not necessarily describe their actions. Practical implications – Bankers, depositors, investors and regulators are likely to benefit from the results of the study when taking decisions related to the banking industry.

We employ an original bank-level data set that splits bank credit portfolios in 21 granular categories, covering household and corporate loans. The results corroborate the presence of a strong procyclical behavior of credit quality, and show a robust negative relationship between the logistic transformation of non-performing loans (NPLs) and GDP growth, with a lag response of up to three quarters. The results also indicate that the procyclical behavior of loan quality varies across credit types. This is novel in the literature and suggests that banks with larger exposures to highly procyclical credit types and economic sectors would tend to undergo sharper deterioration in the quality of their credit portfolios during an economic downturn. Lack of sufficient portfolio granularity in macro stress testing fails to capture these effects and thus introduces a source of bias that tends to underestimate the tail losses stemming from the riskier banks in a system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Banking system | Credit risk | Financial crisis | Stress tests,40,0,,,,undefined,

The process of evaluating the nations and assigning ratings is a business involving various international rating agencies. Governments seek the credit ratings so as to improve their access to the international capital markets. The sovereign credit ratings are an important scale for determining the cost of borrowing to a country. The ratings provide a perception to the lenders about the level of credit risk of the national governments. However, the reliability of the ratings has been a matter of debate in the past due to the methodology followed by the rating agencies. The present paper attempts to check the reliability of these ratings by considering the ratings assigned by two of the major international rating agencies – Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s. This is done through comparison of the ratings assigned by them and checking whether the difference is significant and responsive for the countries rated by both. A regression analysis of the ratings and some of the commonly used indicators by the two agencies to determine the ratings is also done. The results indicate an increase in the average rating difference of the two agencies over time and that the difference in the ratings assigned by the two agencies is statistically significant. Moreover, these agencies are also found to be non-responsive to each other’s ratings. This raises reasonable doubts on the consistency of these ratings as the methodology followed by these agencies involves several common determinants. The regression of the ratings over the determinants indicate that the ratings of these two agencies have more or less the common determinants except the ‘external balances’ indicator exclusively determining the S&P ratings. Considering the fact that the ratings provided by these two agencies are significantly different from each other, the differences in the ratings could be explained by the differences in the weights attached to the determinants by the two agencies. However, a test of significance for the differences in weights of the given set of indicators attached by the two agencies reveals that there is no significant difference in the weights. Thus, the differences can also be attributed to the weights attached to the subjective criteria used by these agencies in order to decide the ratings. Such criteria imply the qualitative biases built by the agencies against nations on the basis of social and political conditions and their reactions to news regarding the changes in the capital markets of a nation.",Credit rating agencies | Credit ratings | Sovereign ratings transparency,6,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,IIMA,undefined,Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad

Design/methodology/approach-The paper employs the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) which allows for the examination of five different indices: Total factor productivity change (TFPCH); technological change (TECHCH); efficiency change (EFFCH); pure technical efficiency change (PEFFCH); and scale efficiency change (SECH) indices. Findings-The empirical findings indicate that the State Owned Commercial Banks (SOCB), Joint Stock Commercial Banks (JSCB), and City Commercial Banks (CCB) have exhibited lower TFPCH levels with the inclusion of risk factor. It was found that the JSCB and CCB have exhibited lower TFPCH due to TECHCH, while the SOCB have exhibited lower TFPCH due to EFFCH. The empirical findings suggest that the inclusion of credit risk factor has resulted in a higher JSCB EFFCH levels. On the other hand, the SOCB and CCB have exhibited a lower EFFCH levels due to SECH and PEFFCH, respectively. Research limitations/implications-The results clearly highlight the importance of credit risk and lending quality in determining the total factor productivity change of banks operating in the China banking sector. The author demonstrates that the inclusion of credit risk factor has resulted in a lower TFPCH level of all banks operating in the China banking sector. Thus, excluding the credit risk factor from the analysis on the China banking sector may potentially bias the result upwards. Practical implications-In an environment of heavy government influence over the lending process, a large proportion of loans extended by Chinese banks over the years have gone bad. Policymakers should prevent the flow of new non-performing loans by separating bad clients from banks that are being restructured and recapitalized in the reform of the banking sector. Originality/value-By employing the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI), the present paper contributes to the existing literature by examining, for the first time, the impact of credit risk on China banks’ total factor productivity.

As an alternative, some methods have incorporated non-normal variables in the estimation of the probability of default in loan portfolios and credit derivatives. One of the objectives of these methods is to express heavy tails of the distributions (which tends to better represent the reality of the credit market since economic and financial variables typically present more extreme occurrences than indicated by the normal distribution). However, as this paper shows, the derivation of some of these alternative models does not comply with all the assumptions implicit in the formula used to develop the models and this mistake results in misleading dependence measures. Our theoretical arguments are supported by simulations which show that, in terms of the calculation of regulatory capital for financial institutions, models for non-normal variables overestimate losses and this bias is substantial for high levels of confidence (up to 13 times higher than the losses observed in the simulated credit portfolio). We present some ideas to start solving this problem although the estimation of the dependence parameter is still an open question. © 2011, Banking and Finance Review.",Copulas | Credit risk | Dependence measure | Inaccuracy | Non-normal variables,1,0,,,,undefined,

Supervisors receive reports on proportions of performing and non-performing aggregate loan classes of individual banks-corporate, mortgage and consumer-often with very short history. The transition to different proportions of aggregate credit qualities can be seen as a Markov process and Christodoulakis [J. Credit Risk, 2007, 3(3), 25-39] proposed a simulation-based method for the estimation of transition probabilities under non-negativity constraints, based on the work of Kloek and van Dijk [Econometrica, 1978, 46(1), 1-19] and van Dijk and Kloek [J. Econometrics, 1980, 14, 307-328]. This paper provides Monte Carlo robustness checks for the performance of this estimator in comparison to Least Squares and Restricted Least Squares (OLS-R) in the presence of ultra-small samples. When true transition probabilities are very large or very small, the least squares estimators severely violate nonnegativity restrictions, leading to a spuriously small bias as compared to Monte Carlo integration (MCI). This result is intensified for low volatility regimes and small samples. The bias of MCI diminishes in higher volatility regimes and larger samples, irrespective of the number of Bayesian replications. Regarding the accuracy statistics, we observe that the variance of every estimator increases in smaller samples and lower volatility regimes. MCI is revealed as more accurate or at least equivalent to OLS-R in all cases. Our empirical applications with real US and European data on aggregate credit portfolios revealed significant violations of non-negativity constraints by least squares methods, which contribute to favourable conclusions for MCI. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Credit risk | Markov process | Non-performing credit | Probability | Transition,0,0,,,,undefined,

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be socially and legally fair from a viewpoint of social responsibility; namely, it must be unbiased and nondiscriminatory in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. From a privacy-preserving viewpoint, this can be interpreted as hiding sensitive information when classification results are observed. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models.

The new grand model consists of the two pillars: a long-term cash flow prediction model and a credit risk spread assessment model. The calculated values derived from these models are effectively usable for reasonable calculation of risk spreads.

We emphasize the need for a latent component to prevent a downward bias in estimated default rate volatility and in estimated probabilities of extreme default losses on portfolios of U.S. debt. The latent factor does not substitute for a single omitted macroeconomic variable. We argue that it captures different omitted effects at different times.

However, in practical application, the similarity metrics calculated by this means often estimate the actual situation with bias because different features have different units and magnitudes. To avoid this problem, method of feature normalization is usually employed before the implementation of case retrieval. In this study on performance of CBR in classification, distance-based case retrieval was, respectively, implemented on eight binary classification data sets, including two credit scoring datasets and one bankruptcy prediction dataset, after, respectively, implementing seven feature normalized methods on the datasets. The results show that: 1) The two data normalization methods of T3, namely: scaling feature values into the range of 0 to 1 by revised minimum-maximum normalization, and T7, namely: the use of normalization utility function, helped CBR perform the best on 3 out of 8 data sets; 2) the data normalization method of T4, namely: dividing by the maximum value of the feature or maximum normalization, made CBR perform better on 7 out of 8 data sets than the other methods; 3) The data normalization method of T7 helped CBR improve classification performance on 6 out of 8 data sets. As a whole, T7 and T4, followed by T3/T2(minimum-maximum normalization) and T1(Z-score)/T6(Standard deviation normalization), are the best feature normalization methods for distance- based CBR in classification (including bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring problems), as they obtain the top ranking scores in the experiment.

Dynamic intensity-based models, in which a firm default is governed by a stochastic intensity process, are widely used to model correlated default risk. The computations in these models can be performed by Monte Carlo simulation. The standard simulation method, which requires the discretization of the intensity process, leads to biased simulation estimators. The magnitude of the bias is often hard to quantify. This paper develops an exact simulation method for intensity-based models that leads to unbiased estimators of credit portfolio loss distributions, risk measures, and derivatives prices. In a first step, we construct a Markov chain that matches the marginal distribution of the point process describing the binary default state of each firm. This construction reduces the original estimation problem to one involving a Markov chain expectation. In a second step, we estimate the Markov chain expectation using a simple acceptance/rejection scheme that facilitates exact sampling. To address rare event situations, the acceptance/rejection scheme is embedded in an overarching selection/mutation scheme, in which a selection mechanism adaptively forces the chain into the regime of interest.

Resolving this empirical puzzle is highly important because, firstly, asset correlations are a key driver of credit risk and, secondly, both data sources are widely used to calibrate risk models of financial institutions. By means of a simulation study, we explore the hypothesis that differences in the correlation estimates are due to a substantial downward bias characteristic of estimates based on default rates. By varying the time horizon, the default probability, the asset correlation and the number of firms in the portfolio, we investigate these estimators in a systematic comparative study. Our results suggest that correlation estimates from equity returns are more efficient than those from default rates. This finding still holds if the model is misspecified such that asset correlations follow a Vasicek process which affects foremost the estimates from equity returns. The results lend support for the hypothesis that the downward bias of default-rate based estimates is an important although not the only factor to explain the differences in correlation estimates.

In practice, using a single method inevitably introduces undesirable estimation bias. Instead, this paper proposes a bagging feature selection model, which is an ensemble learning approach, to identify the most significant features that determine the credit worthiness of customers. The experimental results demonstrate promising results using bagging feature selection model as compared to fundamental models for personal credit risk analysis. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Credit risk | Ensemble learning | Feature selection,11,0,,,,undefined,

Internal data are the primary data source for PD estimates; banks are permitted to use statistical default prediction models to estimate the borrowers PD, subject to some requirements concerning accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of data. However, in practice, internal records are usually incomplete or do not contain adequate history to estimate the PD. Current missing data are critical with regard to low default portfolios, characterised by inadequate default records, making it difficult to design statistically significant prediction models. Several methods might be used to deal with missing data such as list-wise deletion, application-specific list-wise deletion, substitution techniques or imputation models (simple and multiple variants). List-wise deletion is an easy-to-use method widely applied by social scientists, but it loses substantial data and reduces the diversity of information resulting in a bias in the model's parameters, results and inferences. The choice of the best method to solve the missing data problem largely depends on the nature of missing values (MCAR, MAR and MNAR processes) but there is a lack of empirical analysis about their effect on credit risk that limits the validity of resulting models. In this paper, we analyse the nature and effects of missing data in credit risk modelling (MCAR, MAR and NMAR processes) and take into account current scarce data set on consumer borrowers, which include different percents and distributions of missing data. The findings are used to analyse the performance of several methods for dealing with missing data such as likewise deletion, simple imputation methods, MLE models and advanced multiple imputation (MI) alternatives based on MarkovChain-MonteCarlo and re-sampling methods. Results are evaluated and discussed between models in terms of robustness, accuracy and complexity. In particular, MI models are found to provide very valuable solutions with regard to credit risk missing data. © 2010 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Underestimating the number of discrete states has an economically significant impact on forecast quality. Generally speaking, discrete models underestimate the high-quantile default rate forecasts. Continuous-state HMMs, however, vastly overestimate high quantiles if the true HMM has a discrete state space. In the reverse setting the biases are much smaller, though still substantial in economic terms. We illustrate the empirical differences using US default data.

Our study is based on industrial French firms, uses a data-set of 583 bankrupt firms over the period 1998–2000 and tests the effects of different proportions of non-bankrupt firms in the sample.

Very little is known about how enforcement works: What broken rules are being enforced? By whom? How serious are the violations? How effective is enforcement, which presumably should discourage others from breaking important capital rules? The data are from enforcement actions over the last 6 to 10 years by US regulators, who are unique in publishing them. Even though the capital adequacy rules differ for banks and securities firms, the approaches to enforcing them overlap enough to allow rough comparison. This chapter finds a very low number of formal enforcement actions. Most target the small firms or individuals, not the big firms. Formal actions are particularly rare against the largest banks and securities firms, those that pose the greatest threat to the financial system. All but one of the capital adequacy violations resulted from fraud, theft, or other forms of operational risk. Only one resulted from credit risk. The chapter examines possible explanations of the findings, such as the relatively strong economy during much of the period and the possibility that very effective supervision catches almost all firms before their capital falls too low. Evidence from case studies of failed banks suggests that supervisors need to do a better job relating a bank's apparently adequate capital to its risk exposure, and to force banks to implement proposals regulators make to remedy deficiencies. Perhaps the very limited enforcement against large firms reflects a regulatory bias in their favor rather than their underlying strength and adequate capital.",Banks | Capital adequacy regulation | Credit risk | Formal actions | Operational risk | Risk management | Securities firms,6,0,,,,undefined,

This paper explores the extent to which, given the previous cutoff score applied to decide on accepted applicants, the number of included variables influences the efficacy of a commonly used reject inference technique, reweighting. The analysis benefits from the availability of a rare sample, where virtually no applicant was denied credit. The general indication is that the efficacy of reject inference is little influenced by either model leanness or interaction between model leanness and the rejection rate that determined the sample. However, there remains some hint that very lean models may benefit from reject inference where modelling is conducted on data characterized by a very high rate of applicant rejection. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Many empirical tests show that the Merton model overestimates corporate bond prices substantially. However, there are other empirical works defensing that the Merton model is useful in predicting default and performs well in estimating deposit insurance fund. In this paper, we argue that the poor performance of the Merton model may be the consequence of using proxies in empirical studies. Specifically, we show theoretically that using sum of market value of equity and book value of corporate liabilities as a proxy for the market value of corporate assets generates significant bias of overestimating the asset values. It follows that the market value of corporate bond, as a risk-free bond less a put option on corporate asset, would be overestimated under the Merton approach. We propose that the asset values and volatilities are better estimated with maximum liklihood estimation (MLE). To support this claim, we conduct a simulation and an empirical study. Our empirical results document that, if MLE is adopted, the Merton model can overestimate or underestimate the bond prices with the average percentage error of 0.16%.",Corporate Bond Pricing | Credit Risk | Merton's Model | MLE,3,0,,,,undefined,

This suggests syndicates are structured to enhance monitoring efforts and to facilitate renegotiation if borrowers become financially distressed. Since loan sales can change a syndicate's structure, lead banks often constrain such activity. Limiting resales results in larger, more diffuse syndicates at the loan origination stage, however. Syndicates also grow larger and more diffuse when arrangers are more reputable, when loans have longer terms to maturity, and when borrowers hold more growth options.

However in many applications this assumption is invalid. For example, lending institutions create models of who is likely to repay a loan from training sets consisting of people in their records to whom loans were given in the past; however, the institution approved loan applications previously based on who was thought unlikely to default. Learning from only approved loans yields an incorrect model because the training set is a biased sample of the general population of applicants. The issue of including rejected samples in the learning process, or alternatively using rejected samples to adjust a model learned from accepted samples only, is called reject inference. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic analysis of different cases that arise in reject inference, with explanations of which cases arise in various real-world situations. We use Bayesian networks to formalize each case as a set of conditional independence relationships and identify eight cases, including the familiar missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR) cases. For each case we present an overview of available learning algorithms.

Such is true in cancer, for example, where biomarkers are sought for early detection and where improvements in imaging methods may pick up the initial functional and molecular changes associated with cancer development. In other binary classification tasks, computational algorithms such as neural networks, support vector machines, and evolutionary algorithms have been applied to areas as diverse as credit scoring, object recognition, and peptide-binding prediction. Before a classifier becomes an accepted technology, it must undergo rigorous evaluation to determine its ability to discriminate between states. Characterization of factors influencing classifier performance is an important step in this process. Analysis of covariates may reveal subpopulations in which classifier performance is greatest or identify features of the classifier that improve accuracy. We develop regression methods for the nonparametric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, a well-accepted summary measure of classifier accuracy. The estimating function generalizes standard approaches and, interestingly, is related to the two-sample Mann-Whitney U statistic. Implementation is straightforward, because it is an adaptation of binary regression methods. Asymptotic theory is nonstandard, because the regressor variables are cross-correlated. Nevertheless, simulation studies show that the method produces estimates with small bias and reasonable coverage probability.

Individual default risk estimates are used to compose a value-at-risk (VaR) measure of credit risk. In general, credit-scoring models suffer from a sample-selection bias. The starting point is therefore to estimate an unbiased scoring model using the bivariate probit approach. The paper uses a large data set with Swedish consumer credit data that contains extensive financial and personal information on both rejected and approved applicants. We study how marginal changes in a default-risk-based acceptance rule would shift the size of the bank's loan portfolio, its VaR exposure and average credit losses. Finally, we compare the risk in the sample portfolio with that in an efficiently provided portfolio of equal size. The results show that the size of a small consumer loan does not affect associated default risk, implying that the bank provides loans in a way that is not consistent with default-risk minimization.

First, we compare the classification accuracy of a model based only on accepted applicants, relative to one based on a sample of all applicants. We find only a minimal difference, given the cutoff scores for the old model used by the data supplier. Using a simulated model we examine the predictive performance of models estimated from bands of applicants, ranked by predicted creditworthiness. We find that the lower the risk band of the training sample, the less accurate the predictions for all applicants. We also find that the lower the risk band of the training sample, the greater the overestimate of the true performance of the model, when tested on a sample of applicants within the same risk band - as a financial institution would do. The overestimation may be very large. Second, we examine the predictive accuracy of a bivariate probit model with selection (BVP). This parameterises the accept-reject model allowing for (unknown) omitted variables to be correlated with those of the original good-bad model.

In a two-factor model of the marked-to-market value of the credit line (CL), x, and its mean-reverting volatility, V, the value of the American commitment put is obtained as the sum of a Fourier-based solution for the European put and a quadratic approximation for the early-exercise premium. Once computed, the put value is combined with the line fees and a conditional exercise-cum-takedown proportion to determine the commitment net value and the bank's exposure to commitment credit risk. A comparison between the stochastic and constant volatility option models reveals that correlation rather than stochastic volatility forms the greater source of bias: the impact of the correlation-generated skewness on the distribution of the CL marked-to-market value is more significant than that of the σ-generated kurtosis. The random-volatility model is next used to ascertain how commitment credit risk affects banks' capital requirement. According to the BIS accounting-based procedure, the risk-adjusted balance of short-term commitments is nil; this is not the case when the same risk-adjusted balance is computed by way of the option-based procedure. Beyond capital sufficiency, the approach also determines the impact of commitment credit risk on the bank's future profits. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Such models are increasingly used in setting financial institution capital structure, in internal control and compensation systems, in asset-backed security design, and are being considered for use in setting regulatory capital requirements for banks. This paper empirically examines properties of the major methods currently used to estimate average default probabilities by grade. Evidence of potential problems of bias, instability, and gaming is presented. With care, and perhaps judicious application of multiple methods, satisfactory estimates may be possible. In passing, evidence is presented about other properties of internal and rating-agency ratings. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Capital regulation | Credit ratings | Credit risk | Debt default | G11 | G20 | G31 | G33 | Value at risk,89,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Stress tests are often proposed to compensate for this bias, but these measures tend to be arbitrary and cannot be uniformly applied to setting prices and limits as readily as more standardized approaches. The author proposes a framework in which standard measures of counterparty exposure are conditioned on default probabilities. These conditional measures thus account for “rong way” exposures, but fit naturally into current applications. © Emerald Backfiles 2007.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

The most important migration is to default. While default rate empirical studies of corporate bonds are now commonplace, there has never been a study on the default rate in the corporate bank loan market. This paper assesses, for the first time, the default rate experience on large, syndicated bank loans. The results are stratified by original loan rating using a mortality rate framework for the 1991-1996 period. We find that the mortality rates on bank loans are remarkably similar to that of corporate bonds when measured cumulatively over the five-year period after issuance, but loan default rates appear to be considerably higher than bonds for the first two years after issuance. Since loans have an average effective maturity of under two years, this shorter maturity difference is of considerable relevance, especially if confirmed when our database will cover a longer sample period and more actual defaults. We do attempt to estimate the impact and bias on our results of the study's sample period which only covers the recent benign credit cycle in the US. Our results provide important new information for assessing the risk of corporate loans not only for bankers but also mutual fund investors and analysts of structured financial products, credit derivatives and credit insurance. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",Bank loans | Credit risk | Defaults | G21 | G3 | G33 | Mortality rates,56,0,,,,undefined,

Cognitive biases in estimating the probability of such losses may lead to disaster myopia. In periods of benign financial conditions, disaster myopia is likely to lead to decisions regarding allocations of economic capital, the pricing of credit risk, and the range of borrowers who are deemed creditworthy, that make the financial system increasingly vulnerable to crisis.

Variables are represented by nodes, and the absence of an edge between two nodes signifies their conditional independence. While graphical modelling has been used in several applications of statistics, credit scoring has only recently been suggested as a suitable candidate. This paper suggests the following potential uses for graphical models: to display and interpret the associations between variables taken from a credit-card application form; to compare the credit scoring of subpopulations; to give a description of the credit-scoring selection process in terms of influence diagrams; and to assess the effect of selection bias and stratification on the interdependency of variables. These methods are discussed in relation to the analysis of a subset of variables from a stratified sample of credit-card applicants. The large number of variables measured in an application form requires the statistical analysis of large sparse contingency tables. It is shown here that tractable graphical models can be extracted from fitting the relatively simple all-two-way interaction model. © Oxford University Press 1998.",,6,0,,,,undefined,

These regulations implicitly assume that different agencies have equivalent rating scales, despite the fact that some agencies assign systematically higher ratings than others. We assess the appropriateness of these regulatory practices by testing whether observed rating differences reflect different rating scales or simply result from sample selection bias. Our analysis reveals only limited evidence of selection bias. We also ask what types of firms are most likely to seek ratings from the agencies with higher rating scales. Our analysis uncovers no evidence that firms seek ratings from these agencies to clear specific regulatory hurdles or to reduce ex ante uncertainty about default risk. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper provides both a theoretical and empirical framework for evaluating such standards. A model outlining a pricing methodology for loans subject to default risk is presented. The model shows that the returns on such loans are affected by the complicated interaction of the likelihood of default, the consequences of default, term structure variables, and the pricing of factor risks in the economy. When we examine whether the risk weights accurately reflect bank asset risk, we find that the weights fail even in their limited goal of correctly quantifying credit risk. For example, our findings indicate that the RBC weights over-penalize home mortgages, which have an average credit loss of 13 basis points, relative to commercial and consumer loans. The RBC rules also contain a significant bias against direct mortgages relative to mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we find large differences in the credit riskiness of loans within the 100% weight class and potentially large benefits to loan diversification, neither of which are considered in the RBC regulations. We also examine other types of bank risk by estimating a simple factor model that decomposes loan risk into term structure, default, and market risk. One implication of our findings is that although banks have reallocated their portfolios in ways intended by the RBC standards, they may have merely substituted one type of risk (term structure risk) for others (default and market risk), of which the net effect is unknown.",Capital standards | Commercial bank | Credit risk | Factor risk | Mortgages | Risk,6,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

It then develops a model for distribution of the costs as a many-person cooperative game, akin to Littlechild's work on the distribution of costs in public utilities. It uses this to discuss the results of applying different concepts of fairness to the distribution of costs.

The cognitive view of knowledge representation was used as a basic ingredient in understanding how loan officers may not rationally process accounting information. This study presents a path analysis model (covariance model) which describes how loan officers' parallel processing affects their decisions of whether or not to make loans. The results from this study implied that certain decision makers benefited by retrieving more different parallel cues in the first stage and second stage of processing information. The results further imply that users of information generally priorized selected information in order to come to a decision point. It is important to understand decision makers' knowledge representation in the first and second stage of processing in order to explain and predict what types of information are priorized before a final decision is made. Also, if decision makers are aware of their processing biases they may be able to correct and modify their future actions. © 1991.",,26,0,,,NSF,-8703900,National Science Foundation

The size of the governmental audit budget (beyond the minimum level prescribed by generally accepted auditing standards) is ultimately a cost/benefit decision, with lower borrowing costs being one of several potential benefits. In testing for empirical regularities between auditing quantity and investor decisions, we found the size of the audit budget to be indeed associated with borrowing costs, but the direction of the relationship was anomalous. The anomalous positive sign for the audit budget variable could be due to self-selection bias. Self-selection bias is a confounding effect that has come up repeatedly to muddy the interpretation of empirical findings in prior (corporate) market based research on discretionary accounting variables. The supply of (discretionary) internal and operational audits may be driven by operational considerations (e.g., internal control weaknesses), which cannot be directly observed by outsiders. The bond markets may be interpreting the size of the audit budget as a signal about underlying economic characteristics that make the state a more risky investment. Alternatively, larger state audit budgets may signal less use of private sector auditors and be interpreted as less useful to investors (though, possibly more useful to governmental concerns focusing on compliance issues). Despite the inclusion of CPAs' audit fees in state budgets, the signal ""inferred"" for the state's municipalities may have a carryover effect onto state issues. © 1986.",,5,0,,,,undefined,

This article examines the theoretical requirements of the MDA model in the context of a realistic lending situation and illustrates the extent of bias when these theoretical assumptions are not fully met. The article concludes that failure to rigorously meet all the theoretical assumptions of the statistical model may not be as critical as insuring that credit managers fully understand the limitations of these types of decision tools.
