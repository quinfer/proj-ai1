We define and implement a credit loss model based on prospective point-in-time probabilities of default. We determine these probabilities of default and the credits' stage allocation through a credit stochastic simulation. This simulation is based on the estimation of transition matrices. Using data from 1981 to 2019, in a non-homogeneous Markov chain setting, we estimate transition matrices conditional on the global real gross domestic product growth. This allows considering the effects of the economic cycle, which are of great importance in bank management. Finally, we develop a robust optimization model that allows the bank manager to analyze the trade-off between the annual average portfolio income and the corresponding portfolio volatility. According to the proposed bi-objective model, we compute the efficient credit portfolios constructed based on 10-year maturity credits. We compare their structure to those generated by the IAS 39 and CECL accounting frameworks. The results indicate that the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks generate efficient credit portfolios whose structure penalizes riskier-rated credits. In turn, the riskier efficient credit portfolios under the IAS 39 framework concentrate entirely on speculative-grade credits. This pattern is also encountered in efficient credit portfolios constructed based on credits with different maturities, namely 5 and 15 years. Moreover, the longer the maturity of the credits that enter into the composition of the efficient portfolios, the more the speculative-grade credits tend to be penalized.",CECL | credit risk | IAS 39 | IFRS 9 | stochastic simulation | transition matrices,0,0,repositoryam,Green,FCT,CEECIND/01010/2017,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia

Simply designing the static reward function for deep reinforcement learning may be difficult to guide an agent to adapt to the change of the customer credit scoring environment. To solve this problem, we propose the deep Q-network with the confusion-matrix-based dynamic reward function (DQN-CMDRF) model. Especially, the new constructed dynamic reward function can adjust the reward dynamically according to the change of confusion matrix after each deep Q-network model training, which can guide the agent to adapt to the change of environment quickly, so as to improve the customer credit scoring performance of the deep Q-network model. First, we formulate customer credit scoring as a finite Markov decision process. Second, to adjust the reward dynamically according to the customer credit scoring environment, the dynamic reward function is designed based on the confusion matrix. Finally, we introduce the confusion-matrix-based dynamic reward function into the deep Q-network model for customer credit scoring. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we introduce four evaluation measures and make a series of experiments on the five customer credit scoring datasets. The experimental results show that the constructed dynamic reward function can more effectively improve customer credit scoring performance of the deep Q-network model, and the performance of the DQN-CMDRF model is significantly better than that of the other eight traditional classification models.

The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we propose a model for credit insurance portfolios taking into account the contagion risk via self-exciting jump processes. Secondly, we extend the approach of Pelsser and Ghalehjooghi to credit insurance in this framework. Starting from classical time-inconsistent actuarial pricing methods, we derive partial integro-differential equations (PIDE) for their time-consistent counterparts. We discuss numerical methods for solving these PIDEs and their results. We draw two conclusions from these results. On the one hand, we show that time-consistent evaluations tend to give higher prices, compared to time-inconsistent evaluations. On the other hand, our results show that the time-consistency of evaluations allows to better take into account the risk of contagion in credit insurance, if such a risk exists.

This paper uses the annual interest table data of each product of the bank and combines the portfolio optimization model to study the credit risk and financial planning of bank customers. The results show that for customers with different risk tendencies, the proportion of their investment in deposits and financial products is significantly different. The discriminant model is used to classify product customers and get high quality customers.

Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting, the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of such 'naive updating' when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen. We complement these findings with a discussion of several potential routes to overcome these issues.",,5,0,,,ATI,EP/T001569/1,Alan Turing Institute

In the insurance industry an important question arises, namely: how can insurance renewal prices be adjusted? Such an adjustment has two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, insurers are forced to retain existing customers, while on the other hand insurers are also forced to increase revenue. Intuitively, one might assume that revenue increases by offering high renewal prices, however this might also cause many customers to terminate their contracts. Contrarily, low renewal prices help retain most existing customers, but could negatively affect revenue. Therefore, adjusting renewal prices is a non-trivial problem for the insurance industry. In this paper, we propose a novel modelization of the renewal price adjustment problem as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, as a Markov decision process (MDP). In particular, this study analyzes two different strategies to carry out this adjustment. The first is about maximizing revenue analyzing the effect of this maximization on customer retention, while the second is about maximizing revenue subject to the client retention level not falling below a given threshold. The former case is related to MDPs with a single criterion to be optimized. The latter case is related to Constrained MDPs (CMDPs) with two criteria, where the first one is related to optimization, while the second is subject to a constraint.

However, most of them employ a static combiner to combine base classifiers, which do not consider the base classifiers’ characters and their dynamic classification ability. Though some dynamic ensemble methods are proposed, they need to produce a large number of base classifiers or employ a fixed combiner, which limit the generality of the ensemble methods. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic weighted ensemble method for credit scoring. Markov Chain is employed to model the change of each classifier’s classification ability and build a dynamic weighted trainable combiner, which dynamically assign weights to the base classifiers for each sample in the testing set. Through eight credit data sets from the real world, the experimental study demonstrates the ability and efficiency of the dynamic weighted ensemble method to improve prediction performance against the benchmark models, including some well-known individual classifiers and dynamic ensemble methods. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively decrease the misclassification cost, which can reduce risks for the financial institutions.",Credit scoring | Dynamic weighted ensemble | Machine learning | Markov chain,29,0,,,NSFC,71671019,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Then, we apply RSMC to the monthly time series of the sovereign credit rating of 41 nations from January 1994 to December 2018. At first, we confirm that the estimation of RSMC is superior to a homogeneous Markov chain. It implies that the credit rating dynamics are subject to the underlying economic condition. Secondly, we observe that the second tier and non-investment credit ratings in economic contractions are likely to be downgraded. We also detect the continental clustering of economic contractions for the Asian currency and European sovereign debt crises. Lastly, we discover that the forecasting performance of RSMC is superior to that of the benchmark, especially for the second tier and non-investment credit ratings.

This extension allows for an in-sample classification of subjects who never left their initial states into stayers or movers.

A novel bootstrap procedure is proposed for out of sample validation of the in-sample classification. The bootstrap procedure is also applied to validate the in-sample classification with respect to a more general dichotomy than the MS one.

Empirical results reveal that both discrete and continuous homogeneous Markov chain models systematically overestimate the long term corporate probability of default. However, the continuous nonhomogeneous Markov chain gives both intuitively and empirically appropriate probability of default trajectories. The estimated term structure mathematically and professionally properly expresses the probability of default element of expected loss that can realistically occur in the long-run in Hungarian corporate lending.

The level of credit rating changes from time to time because of random credit risk and, thus, can be modeled by an appropriate stochastic process. Markov chain models have been widely used in the literature to generate credit migration matrices; however, emergent empirical evidences suggest that the Markov property is not appropriate for credit rating dynamics. The purpose of this article is to address the non-Markov behavior of the rating dynamics. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a model based on Markov regenerative process (MRGP) with subordinated semi-Markov process (SMP) to obtain the estimates of rating migration probability matrices and default probabilities. Numerical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model with the help of historical Standard & Poor’s (S&P) credit rating data. Findings: The proposed model implies that rating of a firm in the future not only depends on its present rating, but also on its previous ratings. If a firm gets a rating lower than its previous ratings, there are higher chances of further downgrades, and the issue is called the rating momentum. The model also addresses the ageing problem of credit rating evolution.

They are embedded into the pricing function determining the interest rate of a loan contact, and play crucial role in the credit approval process. However, the currently employed intelligent systems are based on assumptions that completely ignore two key characteristics of financial data, namely their heavy-tailed actual distributions, and their time-series nature. These unrealistic assumptions definitely undermine the performance of the resulting corporate credit rating systems used to inform expert decisions. To address these shortcomings, in this work we propose a novel corporate credit rating system based on Student's-t hidden Markov models (SHMMs), which are a well-established method for modeling heavy-tailed time-series data: Under our approach, we use a properly selected set of financial ratios to perform credit scoring, which we model via SHMMs. We evaluate our method using a dataset pertaining to Greek corporations and SMEs; this dataset includes five-year financial data, and delinquency behavioral information. We perform extensive comparisons of the credit risk assessments obtained from our method with other models commonly used by financial institutions.

In order to have a realistic result we propose an iterated two-step method for solving the given portfolio constraint problem: (a) the first step is designed to optimize the nonlinear problem using a quadratic programming method for finding the long run fraction of the time that the system is in a given state (segment) and an action (promotion) is chosen and, (b) the second step is designed to find the optimal number of customers using a Lagrange programming approach. Both steps are based on the c-variable method to make the problem computationally tractable and obtain the optimal solution for the customer portfolio. The Tikhonov's regularization method is used to ensure the convergence of the objective-function to a single optimal portfolio solution. We prove that the proposed method converges by the Weierstrass theorem: the objective function of the mean-variance customer portfolio problem decreases, it is monotonically non-decreasing and bounded from above. In addition, for solving the customer portfolio problem we consider both, a constant risk-aversion restriction and budget limitations. The constraints imposed by the system produce mixed strategies. Effectiveness of the proposed method is successfully demonstrated theoretically and by a simulated experiment related with credit-card and customer-credit limits approach for a bank.",Credit-card portfolios | Credit-risk management | Customer-credit limits | Markov chains | Mean-variance portfolio | Optimization | Quadratic Lagrange programming,12,0,,,,undefined,

The mixture cure model, one important branch of survival models, is also applied in the context of credit scoring, assuming that the study population is a mixture of never-default and will-default customers. We extend the standard mixture cure model through: (1) relaxing the independence assumption of the probability and the time of default; (2) treating the missing defaulting labels as latent variables and applying an augmentation technique; and (3) introducing a discrete truncated exponential distribution to model the time of default. Our full model is written in a hierarchical form so that the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate corresponding parameters. Through an empirical analysis, we show that both mixture models, the standard mixture cure model and the hierarchical mixture cure model (HMCM), are more advanced in identifying future defaulters while compared with logistic regression.

We model the evolution of the Market among its possible ν-states as an F-inhomogeneous semi-Markov process. This idea leads us to modeling the migration process of defaultable bonds as ν different F-inhomogeneous semi-Markov process. The survival probabilities of a defaultable bond in every credit grade are found. The asymptotic behaviour of the survival probabilities is established under certain conditions. Also, it is proved under what conditions the convergence is geometrically fast. The stochastic foundation of the general stochastic discrete-time Market is provided, by proving that the market is viable, if and only if, there exists an equivalent martingale measure, from which we construct the forward probability measure and under which the discounted default free bond price process for all possible states of the Market is a martingale. The term structure of credit spread and the change of real-world probability measure to forward probability measure are studied. In the form of a theorem it is proved that under certain conditions, changing the real probability measure to a forward probability measure, does not affect the inhomogeneous semi Markov process modeling the migration of defaultable bonds. That is, it is proved that it only changes the basic parameters and we provide a relation among the transition probabilities under the two measures.

Supervisors receive reports on proportions of performing and non-performing aggregate loan classes of individual banks-corporate, mortgage and consumer-often with very short history. The transition to different proportions of aggregate credit qualities can be seen as a Markov process and Christodoulakis [J. Credit Risk, 2007, 3(3), 25-39] proposed a simulation-based method for the estimation of transition probabilities under non-negativity constraints, based on the work of Kloek and van Dijk [Econometrica, 1978, 46(1), 1-19] and van Dijk and Kloek [J. Econometrics, 1980, 14, 307-328]. This paper provides Monte Carlo robustness checks for the performance of this estimator in comparison to Least Squares and Restricted Least Squares (OLS-R) in the presence of ultra-small samples. When true transition probabilities are very large or very small, the least squares estimators severely violate nonnegativity restrictions, leading to a spuriously small bias as compared to Monte Carlo integration (MCI). This result is intensified for low volatility regimes and small samples. The bias of MCI diminishes in higher volatility regimes and larger samples, irrespective of the number of Bayesian replications. Regarding the accuracy statistics, we observe that the variance of every estimator increases in smaller samples and lower volatility regimes. MCI is revealed as more accurate or at least equivalent to OLS-R in all cases. Our empirical applications with real US and European data on aggregate credit portfolios revealed significant violations of non-negativity constraints by least squares methods, which contribute to favourable conclusions for MCI. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Credit risk | Markov process | Non-performing credit | Probability | Transition,0,0,,,,undefined,

Fixed Income, 2000, 9, 43-54]. However, this model is limited in that its framework is completely static, failing to capture the dynamic evolution of the CDO. In general, portfolio credit derivatives are subject to two kinds of risk, a default event risk, when any underlying firm involved in the CDO fails to fulfill its obligations, and credit spread risk, due to the change of the default intensity over time. In dealing with either type of risk, it is absolutely necessary to develop a dynamic model incorporating the stochastic behavior of the macro-economic conditions and their influence on the default intensity. In this paper, a dynamic stochastic model is developed where the macro-economic conditions are assumed to follow a birth-death process, which would affect loss distributions characterized by a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). By exploiting the stochastic structure of the MMPP, efficient computational procedures are established for evaluating time-dependent loss distributions and prices of the CDO. Numerical results are presented, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the model by estimating the underlying parameters based on real market data. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Credit derivatives | Credit risk | Dynamic models | Markov processes,1,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The default state is seen as a ""non working state"". As the semi-Markov process is a generalization of Markov process, the presented model can be seen as a more general migration model. In fact, in semi-Markov environment the distribution function (d. f.) of the waiting time before a transition can be of any type and without the strong constraints of the Markov model. Furthermore, some results on the asymptotic behavior of the presented model are given. This permits the construction of the d. f. of the default random variable for each ""working state"".

The first factor represents the macro economic condition which would affect the default intensities of the two industrial sectors differently. The second factor reflects the influences of the past defaults of corporations against other active corporations, where such influences would affect the two industrial sectors differently. A two-layer Markov chain model is developed, where the macro economic condition is described as a birth-death process, while another Markov chain represents the stochastic characteristics of defaults with default intensities dependent on the state of the birth-death process and the number of defaults in two sectors. Although the state space of the two-layer Markov chain is huge, the fundamental absorbing process with a reasonable state space size could capture the first passage time structure of the two-layer Markov chain, thereby enabling one to evaluate the joint probability of the number of defaults in two sectors via the uniformization procedure of Keilson.

In this paper, we consider the Bayesian approach by applying Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in estimating default probability and asset correlation under serially dependent factor model.

Based on empirical evidence, we propose a parsimonious model that is a mixture of (two) Markov chains, where the mixing is on the speed of movement among credit ratings. We estimate this model using credit rating histories and show that the mixture model statistically dominates the simple Markov model and that the differences between two models can be economically meaningful. The non-Markov property of our model implies that the future distribution of a firm's ratings depends not only on its current rating but also on its past rating history. Indeed we find that two firms with identical current credit ratings can have substantially different transition probability vectors. We also find that conditioning on the state of the business cycle or industry group does not remove the heterogeneity with respect to the rate of movement.

Our methodology employs conditional independence graphs to localize model specification and inferences, thus allowing a considerable gain in flexibility of modelling and efficiency of the computations.",,33,0,,,,undefined,

For this task we use classification trees with soft splits which assign the observations near the split boundary to both branches. Tree models involve an extra complication as the number of parameters varies as the tree grows and shrinks. Hence we adapt the reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure to this model which produces an ensemble of trees representing the posterior distribution. For a real-world credit-scoring application our algorithm yields lower classification errors than bootstrapped versions of regression trees (CART), neural networks, and adaptive splines (MARS). The predictive distribution allows to assess the certainty of credit decisions for new cases and guides the collection of additional information.",,1,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

Described in this paper are tools created for these functions in a large California financial institution. A forecasting model with Markovian structure and nonstationary transition probabilities is used to model the life of a mortgage. Logistic and regression models are used to estimate severity of losses. These models are integrated into a system that allows analysts and managers to depict the expected performance of individual loans and portfolio segments under different economic scenarios. With this information, analysts and managers can establish appropriate loss reserves, suggest pricing differentials to compensate for risk, and make strategic lending decisions.",Decision Support Systems | Financial Models | Forecasting | Logit Modeling | Markov Processes/Chains | Risk Analysis,24,0,,,,undefined,
