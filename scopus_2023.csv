Despite their high predictive accuracy, Machine Learning models may not provide sufficient explainability, robustness and/or fairness; therefore, they may not be trustworthy for the involved stakeholders, such as business users, auditors, regulators and end-customers. To measure the trustworthiness of AI applications, we propose the first Key AI Risk Indicators (KAIRI) framework for AI systems, considering financial services as a reference industry. To this aim, we map the recently proposed regulatory requirements proposed for Artificial Intelligence Act into a set of four measurable principles (Sustainability, Accuracy, Fairness, Explainability) and, for each of them, we propose a set of interrelated statistical metrics that can be employed to measure, manage and mitigate the risks that arise from artificial intelligence. We apply the proposed framework to a collection of case studies, that have been indicated as highly relevant by the European financial institutions we interviewed during our research activities. The results from data analysis indicate that the proposed framework can be employed to effectively measure AI risks, thereby promoting a safe and trustworthy AI in finance.",Accuracy | Explainability | Fairness | Financial risk management | Machine learning | Sustainability,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,101016233,

With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a “Brussels effect” in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries. Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate- and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general. Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI). Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainability in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).",AI act | Artificial intelligence | ChatGPT | EU law | Innovation | Large generative AI models | Product liability | Sustainability,0,1,,,,undefined,

We aim to illustrate the beneficial use of machine learning (ML) methods whose prediction power is increased by adopting fuzzy theory to calculate the default risk with a better selection of the features contributing to it. An important feature of the CBFC method is that membership values obtained as a result of the fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm are used for the purpose of better capturing the structure of an existing system. An extensive comparison is performed to show how CBFC performs compared to the traditional ones for the datasets having different characteristics in terms of the variable types.

However, with the increase in the data volume, the performance of traditional algorithms tends to encounter bottlenecks. Although deep learning methods have advantages in handling big data, they are not commonly applied in credit scoring. As one of the most frequently used methods in deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) use convolutional kernels as feature extraction tools and has been very successful in tasks related to images or text. This is because image and text data naturally have a structural characteristic called spatial local correlation, which means that the pixels or tokens covered by the same convolutional kernel are highly correlated, and they can be jointly processed to extract meaningful feature representations. However, the tabular data used for credit scoring do not naturally have such a characteristic. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel end-to-end soft reordering one-dimensional CNN (SR-1D-CNN), which can adaptively reorganize the original tabular data and make them more conducive to CNN learning. Several real-world credit scoring datasets of different sizes are used for a comprehensive comparison with traditional machine learning classifiers and other deep learning methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the soft reordering mechanism can effectively improve the classification effect of the CNN for tabular data. With the increase in the data scale, the proposed approach obtains superior results to those of other benchmark models.",Convolutional neural networks | Credit scoring | Deep learning | Machine learning | Soft reordering mechanism,0,0,,,,undefined,

This paper aims to achieve the goals of gaining high returns with risk limitations or lowering risks with expected returns for P2P lenders. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used data from a leading online P2P lending platform in America. First, the authors constructed a logistic regression-based credit scoring model and a linear regression-based profit scoring model to predict the default probabilities and profitability of loans. Second, based on the predictions of loan risk and loan return, the authors constructed linear programming model to form the optimal loan portfolio for lenders. Findings: The research results show that compared to a logistic regression-based credit scoring method, the proposed new framework could make more returns for lenders with risks unchanged. Furthermore, compared to a linear regression-based profit scoring method, the proposed new framework could lower risks for lenders without lowering returns. In addition, comparisons with advanced machine learning techniques further validate its superiority. Originality/value: Unlike previous studies that focus solely on predicting the default probability or profitability of loans, this study considers loan allocation in online P2P lending as an optimization research problem using a new framework based upon modern portfolio theory (MPT). This study may contribute theoretically to the extension of MPT in the specific context of online P2P lending and benefit lenders and platforms to develop more efficient investment tools.",Loan allocation strategies | Modern portfolio theory | Online peer-to-peer lending,0,0,,,XJTU,undefined,Xi’an Jiaotong University

It has been used to build credit scorecards, estimate the probability of default or churn, identify the next best product in marketing, and many more applications. The machine learning literature has recently introduced several alternative techniques, such as deep learning neural networks, random forests, and factorisation machines. While neural networks and random forests form part of the practitioner’s model-building toolkit, factorisation machines are seldom used. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of factorisation machines to some binary classification problems in banking. To stimulate the practical application of factorisation machines, we implement the fitting routines, based on logit loss and maximum likelihood, on commercially available software that is widely used by banks and other large financial services companies. Logit loss is usually used by the machine learning fraternity while maximum likelihood is popular in statistics. Depending on the coding of the target variable, we will show that these methods yield identical parameter estimates. Often, banks are confronted with predicting events that occur with low probability. To deal with this phenomenon, we introduce weights in the above-mentioned loss functions. The accuracy of our fitting algorithms is then studied by means of a simulation study and compared with logistic regression. The separation and prediction performance of factorisation machines are then compared to logistic regression and random forests by means of three case studies covering a recommender system, credit card fraud, and a credit scoring application. We conclude that logistic factorisation machines are worthy competitors of logistic regression in most applications, but with clear advantages in recommender systems applications where the number of predictors typically outnumbers the number of observations.",credit scoring | factorisation machines | logistic regression | logit loss | machine learning | maximum likelihood estimation | random forests | recommender system,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

There have been several credit-scoring models proposed in the banking system. These models, either single classifiers or hybrid and ensemble models determine the class of customers (good or bad accounts). The banks need the probability of default to calculate the expected loss and the unexpected loss and then determine whether their capital is adequate. Generally speaking, the proposed model can utilize n classifiers and m performance metrics, the larger n, and m, the more diverse and more reliable the model is as an estimate of customer classes. We evaluated the proposed model using five common classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), AdaBoost, and probabilistic neural network (PNN), and eight performance metrics. To extract the feature, an optimization approach using genetic algorithms and nine different scenarios were used. We have then calculated the optimal parameters of each algorithm simultaneously by defining the cost-sensitive objective function based on the probability of correctly classifying it into two classes 0 (good) and 1 (bad). We evaluated the performance of the proposed hybrid model using the Iranian dataset and the UCI German and Australian datasets. The results indicate the proposed method provides very good scoring performance. Using this approach, the bank can filter its bad customers based on the tolerance it considers for the probability value, so it can decide whether it should provide loans to that customer.",Credit scoring | Genetic algorithm | Hybrid performance metric | Machine learning | Optimization,3,0,,,,undefined,

To address missing credit information, many researchers have used borrowers’ social interactions as an alternative data source. Exploiting social networking data has traditionally been achieved by hand-crafted feature engineering, but lately, graph neural networks have emerged as a promising alternative. Here we introduce an information-processing framework to improve credit scoring models by blending several methods of graph representation learning: feature engineering, graph embeddings, and graph neural networks. In this approach, we aggregate the methods’ outputs to be fed to a gradient boosting classifier to produce a final creditworthiness score. We have validated this framework over a unique multi-source dataset that characterizes the relationships, interactions, and credit history for the entire population of a Latin American country, applying it to credit risk models, application, and behavior. It also allows us to study both individuals and companies. Our results show that the methods of graph representation learning should be used as complements; they should not be seen as self-sufficient methods, as it is currently done. We improve the creditworthiness assessment performance in terms of the measures of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS), outperforming traditional methods of exploiting social interaction data. In the area of corporate lending, where the potential gain is much higher, our results confirm that the evaluation of a thin-file company cannot solely consider the company's own characteristics. The business ecosystem in which these companies interact with their owners, suppliers, customers, and other companies provides novel knowledge that enables financial institutions to enhance their creditworthiness assessment. Our results let us know when and on which population to use graph data and the expected effects on performance.

Therefore, we improve the automatic K-means clustering based on the Calinski–Harabasz index, thus achieving a clustering output for improved results. We also scrutinize representative five single classification models and six ensemble learning models for credit scoring prediction. We empirically test the superior performance of ensemble learning models and identify the best model CatBoost by comparing them based on multiple evaluation indicators.

Traditional credit scoring algorithms frequently rely on manual and rule-based methods, which can be tedious and inaccurate. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have opened up possibilities for creating more reliable and effective credit rating systems. The data are pre-processed, including scaling using the 0–1 normalization method and resolving missing values by imputation. Information gain (IG), gain ratio (GR), and chi-square are three feature selection methodologies covered in the study. While GR normalizes IG by dividing it by the total entropy of the feature, IG quantifies the reduction in total entropy by adding a new feature. Based on chi-squared statistics, the most vital traits are determined using chi-square. This research employs different ML models to develop a hybrid model for credit score prediction. The ML algorithms support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NNs), decision trees (DTs), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) classifiers are employed here for experiments along with IG, GR, and chi-square feature selection methodologies for credit prediction over Australian and German datasets. The study offers an understanding of the decision-making process for informative characteristics and the functionality of machine learning (ML) in credit prediction tasks. The empirical analysis shows that in the case of the German dataset, the DT with GR feature selection and hyperparameter optimization outperforms SVM and NN with an accuracy of 99.78%.

The interpretability of federated learning is a crucial issue due to the lack of user interaction and the complexity of credit data monitoring. We advocate the importance of a credit data processing-as-a-service model, which completes conventional credit models in local environments, in order to overcome these restrictions. In particular, we describe an explainable federated learning and blockchain-based credit scoring system (EFCS) in this work. First, we propose an explainable federated learning method with controllable machine learning efficiency and controllable credit model decision making, thus having controllable credit model complexity and transparent and traceable credit decision-making mechanism. Then, we suggest an explainable federated learning training mechanism for credit data that prevents leakage of the model gradients trained by individual nodes during the training of the overall model. Neither the credit data provider nor the data user has access to the raw data in the credit model training ecosystem. Therefore, privacy protection, model performance, and algorithm efficiency, the core triangular cornerstones of federated learning, when added with model interpretability, together constitute a more secure and trustworthy federated learning-based methodology, thus providing a more reliable service for credit model training and construction. The EFCS scheme is presented via simulations of different types of federated learning and their resistance to system attack, applying the proposed model to six different credit scoring datasets.

Consequently, in this paper, a horizontal federated learning paradigm is used to protect the local private data of each participant and collaborate to train a powerful shared global model. However, in the collaborative training process, heterogeneous data distributions can result in insufficient learning of the model. To overcome this issue, we propose the federated knowledge transfer (FedKT) method, which exploits the advantages of fine-tuning and knowledge distillation to effectively extract generic and specific knowledge from the early layers and outputs of the global model, respectively, thus improving the learning performance of the local models. We adopt five credit datasets and four performance measures to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

This work aims to reduce potential future credit risk, which could have an impact on the bank’s capacity to manage its finances and provide loan to customers. Before extending loan, banks evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness and confirm their eligibility in an effort to reduce credit risk. The majority of the judgement is based on conventional credit scoring models; however, credit worthiness is not always reliable. Through the use of predictive models, this initiative intends to assist banks and financial institutions in locating and interacting with creditworthy customers. Different ML models, namely logistic regression, extra trees classifier, random forest classifier, XGB classifier, LGBM classifier, neural network, support vector machine, ridge classifier, K-nearest neighbour classifier, linear discriminant, and quadratic discriminant, are analysed on two different datasets from Indian market. The experimental results show that LGBM is the best ML model for both the datasets with a predictive accuracy of 0.95426 on dataset1 and 0.96327 on dataset2.

This method is demonstrated for behavior scoring where account delinquency is one of the provided inputs, because behavior scoring has historically presented the most difficulties for combining credit scoring and stress testing.

It is known that Decision Trees (DTs) are suitable for ensembles because they encourage diversity, the key point for the success of an ensemble scheme. Ensembles of DTs have obtained good performance in a wide range of areas, including credit scoring. Some works have highlighted that DTs that employ imprecise probability models, called Credal Decision Trees (CDTs), improve the results of ensembles in credit scoring. The performance of CDT is strongly influenced by a hyperparameter. In fact, it was shown that different values of the hyperparameter might yield different models. Hence, the diversity in ensemble schemes can be increased by randomly selecting the value of the hyperparameter in each CDT, instead of fixing one. In this work, it is shown that increasing the diversity of the ensembles that use CDT by varying the value of the hyperparameter in each base classifier improves the results in credit scoring.

A traditional investigation was carried out using the Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases. The papers selection and classification took place in three steps considering only studies in English language and published in electronic journals (from 2008 to 2022). The investigation led up to the selection of 46 publications (10 presenting literature reviews and 36 proposing CSMs). Findings: The findings showed that CSMs are usually formulated using Financial Analysis, Machine Learning, Statistical Techniques, Operational Research and Data Mining Algorithms. The main databases used by the researchers were banks and the University of California, Irvine. The analyses identified 48 methods used by CSMs, the main ones being: Logistic Regression (13%), Naive Bayes (10%) and Artificial Neural Networks (7%). The authors conclude that advances in credit score studies will require new hybrid approaches capable of integrating Big Data and Deep Learning algorithms into CSMs. These algorithms should have practical issues considered consider practical issues for improving the level of adaptation and performance demanded for the CSMs. Practical implications: The results of this study might provide considerable practical implications for the application of CSMs. As it was aimed to demonstrate the application of optimisation methods, it is highly considerable that legal and ethical issues should be better adapted to CSMs. It is also suggested improvement of studies focused on micro and small companies for sales in instalment plans and commercial credit through the improvement or new CSMs. Originality/value: The economic reality surrounding credit granting has made risk management a complex decision-making issue increasingly supported by CSMs. Therefore, this paper satisfies an important gap in the literature to present an analysis of recent advances in optimisation methods applied to CSMs. The main contribution of this paper consists of presenting the evolution of the state of the art and future trends in studies aimed at proposing better CSMs.",Credit scoring | Literature review | Optimization methods | Risk management,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,CNPq,2700441,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico

This raises important equity concerns about overhauling lending criteria via opaque models that restructure the logic of risk assessment. In following the logic of risk assessment generated by Upstart's model, I also audit three fintech-bank partnerships and examine the balance sheets of banks providing capital via Upstart's platform. This is done to demonstrate rising capital allocation to these types of loans at banks engaged in fintech-bank partnerships, in one case rising from 0.14% to 15.6% of the banks’ balance sheet over three years.

Firstly, customers are segmented into different groups by <FOR VERIFICATION>k-means clustering algorithms and a two-stage weighting method is proposed to determine the significances of attributes by their discriminating powers between groups and within groups. Then, the attribute-related evidence is obtained by Bayesian statistics to represent the relationships between the attributes and credit risks, and a two-stage weighting evidential reasoning (TER) is developed as a base learner for credit scoring. Lastly, multiple base learners TERs are aggregated for evaluating customers' credit risks.

As an example, the credit-worthiness-assessment task is now strongly based on Machine Learning algorithms that make decisions independently from humans. Several studies showed remarkable improvement in reliability, customer care, and return on investment. Nonetheless, many users remain sceptical since they perceive the whole as only partially transparent. The trust in the system decision, the guarantee of fairness in the decision-making process, the explanation of the reasons behind the decision are just some of the open challenges for this task. Moreover, from the financial institution's perspective, another compelling problem is credit-repayment monitoring. Even here, traditional models (e.g., credit scorecards) and machine learning models can help the financial institution in identifying, at an early stage, customers that will fall into default on payments. The monitoring task is critical for the debt-repayment success of identifying bad debtors or simply users who are momentarily in difficulty. The financial institution can thus prevent possible defaults and, if possible, meet the debtor's needs. In this work, the authors propose an architecture for a Creditworthiness-Assessment duty that can meet the transparency needs of the customers while monitoring the credit-repayment risk. This preliminary study carried out an experimental evaluation of the component devoted to the credit-score computation and monitoring credit repayments. The study shows that the authors’ architecture can be an effective tool to improve current Credit-scoring systems. Combining a static and a subsequent dynamic approach can correct mistakes made in the first phase and foil possible false positives for good creditors.",Credit Scoring | Early Warning | Explainability | Fairness,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,101016956,

In order to have a more relevant and accurate classification model, it is necessary for models to be interpreted and understood by financial professionals. The interaction and interpretation of the model becomes more limited as the number of features increases. In order to reduce the number of non significant features, feature selection must be implemented on the original data. The purpose of this study is not only to find a set of logical rules in an easily interpretable form for classification but also to select a set of informative features that can solve the classification problem. To this end, we present a combination of feature selection and rule extraction techniques.

Recently, there has been a surge in the application of machine learning approaches in the design of robust and effective credit scoring models as part of the human social development agenda under the assumption that the variables will remain stable for a long time. However, in real-life, the behavior of customers changes over time and the variables used to quantify the financial credibility of a person for a loan such as past performances on debt obligations, profiling, main household, income and demographics tend to drift and evolve over time. This paper considers credit scoring as an ephemeral scenario as variables tend to drift over time and proposes the application of data stream learning techniques in credit scoring since they are tailored for incremental learning. This makes the scoring model to be able to detect and adapt to changes in the customer behavior. We propose the Adaptive and Dynamic Heterogeneous Ensemble (ADHE) approach that is capable of learning incrementally and adapting to drifting variables and consists of models derived from different learning algorithms to exploit diversity. The prediction performance of ADHE is evaluated using datasets that are publicly available and we compared the accuracy and computational cost of ADHE with existing state of the art models. Our proposed approach performs significantly well when compared to existing state of the art benchmark models on prediction accuracy according to the non-parametric test.",Credit scoring | Diversity | Heterogeneous ensemble | Machine learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

The global problem is to predict the event probability over time. It has applications in healthcare, credit scoring, etc. The most widely used method for assessing the covariate impacts on survival is the Cox proportional hazards approach. However, the assumption of non-overlapping survival functions usually does not hold on real data, and the linear dependence on features limits the quality of the method. There are tree-based machine learning methods to solve these problems. Usually, to evaluate the difference between the samples, it used the log-rank test. Obtained survival decision tree models also have strong interpretability, they can evaluate the importance of predictors, but they demonstrate inferior performance in comparison to Cox proportional hazards models. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new boosting of the survival decision tree model that uses adaptive sampling and weighted log-rank split criteria. The model iteratively corrects an error in the ensemble. Each decision tree is trained on a sample, taking into account the weights of observations and subsequently adjusting the probabilities of getting into the next sample. We introduce an experimental comparison of the proposed adaptive boosting method against Cox proportional hazard and widely used survival trees and their ensembles: random forest and gradient boosting. Experiments on healthcare datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art survival models in terms of the following metrics: the concordance index, the integrated Brier score, and the integrated AUC.",Adaptive boosting | Cox proportional hazard | Gradient boosting survival analysis | Machine learning | Random survival forest | Survival analysis | Time-to-event analysis,0,0,,,,undefined,

For example, in autonomous driving, an object classification model should achieve high detection rates under different conditions of weather, distance, etc. Similarly, in the financial setting, credit-scoring models must not discriminate against minority groups. These conditions or groups are called as 'Data Slices'. In product MLOps cycles, product developers must identify such critical data slices and adapt models to mitigate data slice problems. Discovering where models fail, understanding why they fail, and mitigating these problems, are therefore essential tasks in the MLOps life-cycle. In this paper, we present SliceTeller, a novel tool that allows users to debug, compare and improve machine learning models driven by critical data slices. SliceTeller automatically discovers problematic slices in the data, helps the user understand why models fail. More importantly, we present an efficient algorithm, SliceBoosting, to estimate trade-offs when prioritizing the optimization over certain slices. Furthermore, our system empowers model developers to compare and analyze different model versions during model iterations, allowing them to choose the model version best suitable for their applications.

Therefore, banks attempt to improve the performance of their credit scoring models while ensuring the interpretability of the results. However, there is a tradeoff between the logistic regression model and machine learning-based techniques regarding interpretability and model performance because machine learning-based models are a black box. To deal with the tradeoff, in this study, we present a two-stage logistic regression method based on the Bayesian approach. In the first stage, we generate the derivative variables by linearly combining the original features with their explanatory powers based on the Bayesian inference. The second stage involves developing a credit scoring model through logistic regression using these derivative variables. Through this process, the explanatory power of a large number of original features can be utilized for default prediction, and the use of logistic regression maintains the model's interpretability. In the empirical analysis, the independent sample t-test reveals that our proposed approach significantly improves the model’s performance compared to that based on the conventional single-stage approach, i.e., the baseline model. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics show a 3.42 percentage points (%p) increase, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic shows a 2.61%p increase. Given that our two-stage modeling approach has the advantages of interpretability and enhanced performance of the credit scoring model, our proposed method is essential for those in charge of banking who must explain credit evaluation results and find ways to improve the performance of credit scoring models.",Bayesian approach | Credit scoring model | Machine learning | Two-stage logistic regression,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

To address this challenge, we first harness the internal ratings-based approach to identify up to 13 risk components that we classify into 3 main categories—statistics, technology, and market conduct. Second, to evaluate the importance of each risk category, we collect a series of regulatory documents related to three potential use cases—regulatory capital, credit scoring, or provisioning—and we compute the weight of each category according to the intensity of their mentions, using natural language processing and a risk terminology based on expert knowledge. Finally, we test our framework using popular ML models in credit risk, and a publicly available database, to quantify some proxies of a subset of risk factors that we deem representative. We measure the statistical risk according to the number of hyperparameters and the stability of the predictions. The technological risk is assessed through the transparency of the algorithm and the latency of the ML training method, while the market conduct risk is quantified by the time it takes to run a post hoc technique (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the output.",Artificial intelligence | Bias | Credit risk | Internal ratings based model | Interpretability | IRB model | Machine learning | Natural language processing | NLP,5,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Traditionally, credit-risk management relies on credit scoring that predicts loans’ probability of default. In this paper, we use a profit scoring approach that is based on modeling the annualized adjusted internal rate of returns of loans. To validate our profit scoring models with traditional credit scoring models, we use data from a European P2P lending market, Bondora, and also a random sample of loans from the Lending Club P2P lending market. We compare the out-of-sample accuracy and profitability of the credit and profit scoring models within several classes of statistical and machine learning models including the following: logistic and linear regression, lasso, ridge, elastic net, random forest, and neural networks. We found that our approach outperforms standard credit scoring models for Lending Club and Bondora loans. More specifically, as opposed to credit scoring models, returns across all loans are 24.0% (Bondora) and 15.5% (Lending Club) higher, whereas accuracy is 6.7% (Bondora) and 3.1% (Lending Club) higher for the proposed profit scoring models. Moreover, our results are not driven by manual selection as profit scoring models suggest investing in more loans.

Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major tool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency, explainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction accuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the model accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates explainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with regulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are unlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet regulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and enforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the neural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes monotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of training a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a neural additive model, as a free lunch. We demonstrate through empirical results that our new model is as accurate as black-box fully-connected neural networks, providing a highly accurate and regulated machine learning method.",fairness | model explainability | neural networks,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Local feature attribution methods have become a popular technique for post-hoc and model-agnostic explanations. However, attribution methods typically assume a stationary environment in which the predictive model has been trained and remains stable. As a result, it is often unclear how local attributions behave in realistic, constantly evolving settings such as streaming and online applications. In this paper, we discuss the impact of temporal change on local feature attributions. In particular, we show that local attributions can become obsolete each time the predictive model is updated or concept drift alters the data generating distribution. Consequently, local feature attributions in data streams provide high explanatory power only when combined with a mechanism that allows us to detect and respond to local changes over time. To this end, we present CDLEEDS, a flexible and model-agnostic framework for detecting local change and concept drift. CDLEEDS serves as an intuitive extension of attribution-based explanation techniques to identify outdated local attributions and enable more targeted recalculations. In experiments, we also show that the proposed framework can reliably detect both local and global concept drift. Accordingly, our work contributes to a more meaningful and robust explainability in online machine learning.",concept drift detection | explainable machine learning | local feature attributions | online machine learning,1,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In XGBoost, a well-known and robust classification method, we propose that the quantile function of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is used as a link function to enhance the detection of rare cases. To complement the GEV link function, the study applies a modified focal loss function in XGBoost to jointly penalize misclassification of the class of interest and focus on hard, tricky to classify cases.

In the literature, there have been a number of studies concerning credit risk management, often involving credit scoring systems making use of machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the specificity of individual banks’ datasets means that choosing the techniques best suited to the needs of a given bank is far from straightforward. This study was motivated by the need by Credins Bank in Tirana for a reliable customer credit scoring tool suitable for use with that bank’s specific dataset. The dataset in question presents two substantial difficulties: first, a high degree of imbalance, and second, a high level of bias together with a low level of confidence in the recorded data. These shortcomings are largely due to the relatively young age of the private banking system in Albania, which did not exist as such until the early 2000s. They are shortcomings not encountered in the more conventional datasets that feature in the literature. The present study therefore has a real contribution to make to the existing corpus of research on credit scoring. The first important question to be addressed is the level of imbalance. In practice, the proportion of good customers may be many times that of bad customers, making the impact of unbalanced data on classification models an important element to be considered. The second question relates to bias or incompleteness in customer information in emerging and developing countries, where economies tend to function with a large amount of informality.

This paper proposed a new reject inference method based on a three-way decision and a safe semi-supervised support vector machine (S4VM) model. In credit evaluations, the accepted sample is labeled and the rejected sample is unlabeled. This paper used S4VM to model both the accepted and rejected samples for reject inference. Because of the basic semi-supervised learning assumption that the accepted and rejected sample distributions are similar, this paper used a three-way decision method to filter the rejected samples to ensure the accepted and rejected sample distributions were closer. It was found that this method filtered out some rejected samples that were significantly different from the accepted sample distribution, which reduced the interference in the S4VM low-density separator. The proposed method was verified in four experiments on Chinese credit loan data, with the results verifying the effectiveness of the proposed reject inference S4VM method.",Credit scoring | Reject inference | S4VM | Three-way decision,7,0,,,NSFC,2020YJ0042,Applied Basic Research Program of Sichuan Province

Novel AI applications have been already proposed to deal with challenges in the areas of credit scoring, risk assessment, client experience and portfolio management. One of the most critical challenges in the aforementioned sector is fraud detection upon streams of transactions. Recently, deep learning models have been introduced to deal with the specific problem in terms of detecting and forecasting possible fraudulent events. The aim is to estimate the unknown distribution of normal/fraudulent transactions and then to identify deviations that may indicate a potential fraud. In this paper, we elaborate on a novel multistage deep learning model that targets to efficiently manage the incoming streams of transactions and detect the fraudulent ones. We propose the use of two autoencoders to perform feature selection and learn the latent data space representation based on a nonlinear optimization model. On the delivered significant features, we subsequently apply a deep convolutional neural network to detect frauds, thus combining two different processing blocks. The adopted combination has the goal of detecting frauds over the exposed latent data representation and not over the initial data.",Autoencoder (AE) | Convolutional neural network (CNN) | Dimensionality reduction | Fraud detection | Oversampling techniques | Variational autoencoder (VAE),4,0,,,,undefined,

Although such models have been developed to try to reduce human bias and thus bring greater fairness to financial services decisions, studies have found that there is still significant discrimination by both face-To-face and algorithmic lenders. In fact, Apple has recently been investigated for gender discrimination in assigning a credit limit to its users, demonstrating that there may still be inherent biases in the development of such algorithms and models. Furthermore, biases in financial services models may not only lead to unfair discrimination but were also linked to health problems and recovery prospects. This project aims to analyse and identify the different types of biases found in AI models and data used in the financial services industry. We propose a method using data analysis and explainable models to explain how these biases emerge throughout the process of developing AI models as well as applying state-of-The-Art bias dealing techniques to avoid and mitigate them. Finally, we propose how to evaluate these models according to the business objectives and consider possible trade-offs between different definitions of fairness. Thus, the main questions that this project will try to answer are as follows:-What are the current biases in credit risk and fraud detection models and how to identify them?-In what ways understanding how biases emerge from the data can help us in bias mitigation?-To what extent could credit risk and fraud detection models bias be mitigated, and what are the implications of those mitigation techniques? Answering these questions, we hope to create a pipeline for building these models by understanding the key points where bias can emerge and the appropriate methods to avoid it.",bias | fairness | financial services | machine learning,0,0,,,,undefined,

This selective discard can lead to an inability to increase the number of potentially qualified applicants, ultimately affecting the revenue of the lending platform. One way to deal with this is to employ reject inference, a technique that infers the state of a rejected sample and incorporates the results into a credit-scoring model. The most popular approach to reject inference is to use a credit-scoring model built only on accepted samples to directly predict the status of rejected samples. However, the distribution of accepted samples in online P2P lending is different from the distribution of rejected samples, and the credit-scoring model on the original accepted sample may no longer apply. In addition, the acceptance sample may also include applicants who cannot repay the loan. If these applicants can be filtered out, the losses to the lending platform can also be reduced. Therefore, we propose a global credit-scoring model framework that combines multiple feature selection methods and classifiers to better evaluate the model after adding rejected samples. In addition, this study uses outlier detection methods to explore the internal relationships of all samples, which can delete outlier applicants in accepted samples or increase outlier applicants in rejected samples. Finally, this study uses four data samples and reject inference to construct four different credit-scoring models. The experimental results show that the credit-scoring model combining Pearson and random forest proposed in this study has significantly better accuracy and AUC than other scholars. Compared with previous studies, using outlier detection to remove outliers in loan acceptance samples and identify potentially creditworthy loan applicants from loan rejection samples is a good strategy. Furthermore, this study not only improves the accuracy of the credit-scoring model but also increases the number of lenders, which in turn increases the profitability of the lending platform.",credit scoring | financial markets | machine learning | P2P lending,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,MOST,MOST 110-2410-H-224-010,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan"

In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method that aims to identify and pseudo-label parts of the historically declined loan applications to mitigate sampling bias in the training data.

The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customer's sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens up the door of privacy leakage. A recently invented privacy-preserving distributed ML scheme referred to as Federated learning (FL) enables generating a target model without sharing local information through on-device model training on edge resources. In this paper, we propose an FL-based application to predict customers’ financial issues by constructing a global learning model that is evolved based on the local models of the distributed agents. The local models are generated by the network agents using their on-device data and local resources. We used the FL concept because the learning strategy does not require sharing any data with the server or any other agent that ensures the preservation of customers’ sensitive data. To that end, we enable partial works from the weak agents that eliminate the issue if the model convergence is retarded due to straggler agents. We also leverage asynchronous FL that cut off the extra waiting time during global model generation. We simulated the performance of our FL model considering a popular dataset, Give me Some Credit (Freshcorn, 2017). We evaluated our proposed method considering a a different number of stragglers and setting up various computational tasks (e.g., local epoch, batch size), and simulated the training loss and testing accuracy of the prediction model. Finally, we compared the F1-score of our proposed model with the existing centralized and decentralized approaches. Our results show that our proposed model achieves an almost identical F1-score as like centralized model even when we set up a skew-level of more than 80% and outperforms the state-of-the-art FL models by obtaining an average of 5∼6% higher accuracy when we have resource-constrained agents within a learning environment.",Federated learning | Financial distress | Global model | Local model | Model aggregation | On-device training,10,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,FIU,undefined,Florida International University

This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings: The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89–25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint).

However, logistic regression remains the benchmark in the credit risk industry mainly because the lack of interpretability of ensemble methods is incompatible with the requirements of financial regulators. In this paper, we propose a high-performance and interpretable credit scoring method called penalised logistic tree regression (PLTR), which uses information from decision trees to improve the performance of logistic regression. Formally, rules extracted from various short-depth decision trees built with original predictive variables are used as predictors in a penalised logistic regression model. PLTR allows us to capture non-linear effects that can arise in credit scoring data while preserving the intrinsic interpretability of the logistic regression model. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications using four real credit default datasets show that PLTR predicts credit risk significantly more accurately than logistic regression and compares competitively to the random forest method.",Credit scoring | Econometrics | Interpretability | Machine learning | Risk management,68,0,repositoryvor,Green,IAAE,ANR-19-CE26-0002-02,International Association for Applied Econometrics

The paper makes three contributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine their adequacy for credit scoring. Second, we catalog algorithmic options for incorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline. Last, we empirically compare different fairness processors in a profit-oriented credit scoring context using real-world data. The empirical results substantiate the evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions. We find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once and recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a scorecard.

Reasons for this may be not only the regulatory requirement of model comprehensiveness but also the possibility to integrate analysts’ expert knowledge in the modelling process. Although several commercial software companies offer specific solutions for modelling credit scorecards, open-source frameworks for this purpose have been missing for a long time. In recent years, this has changed, and today several R packages for credit scorecard modelling are available.

This article explores from an interdisciplinary point of view the connection between existing legal requirements for the explainability of AI systems set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the current state of the art in the field of explainable AI. It studies the challenges of providing human legible explanations for current and future AI-based decision-making systems in practice, based on two scenarios of automated decision-making in credit scoring risks and medical diagnosis of COVID-19. These scenarios exemplify the trend towards increasingly complex machine learning algorithms in automated decision-making, both in terms of data and models. Current machine learning techniques, in particular those based on deep learning, are unable to make clear causal links between input data and final decisions. This represents a limitation for providing exact, human-legible reasons behind specific decisions, and presents a serious challenge to the provision of satisfactory, fair and transparent explanations. Therefore, the conclusion is that the quality of explanations might not be considered as an adequate safeguard for automated decision-making processes under the GDPR. Accordingly, additional tools should be considered to complement explanations. These could include algorithmic impact assessments, other forms of algorithmic justifications based on broader AI principles, and new technical developments in trustworthy AI. This suggests that eventually all of these approaches would need to be considered as a whole.",,23,0,,,,undefined,

In this paper, we use Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques to produce inherently interpretable scoring systems under sparsity and fairness constraints, for the general multi-class classification setup. Our work generalizes the SLIM (Supersparse Linear Integer Models) framework that was proposed by Rudin and Ustun to learn optimal scoring systems for binary classification. The use of MILP techniques allows for an easy integration of diverse operational constraints (such as, but not restricted to, fairness or sparsity), but also for the building of certifiably optimal models (or sub-optimal models with bounded optimality gap).",Fairness | Interpretability | Machine Learning | Mixed-Integer Linear Programming | Multi-class Classification | Scoring System,0,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

To minimize the risk of loan default which eventually may lead to bad debt; the banks use statistical models to determine the customer loan eligibility. There is a transition from the statistical models for predicting eligibility for bank loans to the use of machine learning models and several pieces of research have been carried out in this direction, but the accuracy is still a challenge. In our research work, we adopted a cascade of a pre-Trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to realize a loan eligibility model. An 11-layer DNN with a sigmoid output layer was trained with a loan credit dataset obtained from Kaggle and the output layer was removed which then makes SoftMax with 64 outputs a new output layer. The DNN is then used to transform the original 11-feature dataset into a 64-feature high dimension dataset. An SVM with a polynomial kernel was trained on the original dataset and achieved an accuracy of 87% but the same SVM achieved an accuracy of 97.05% when trained with the transformed high dimension dataset obtained from the pre-Trained DNN.

One upshot is that credit risk assessments must be explainable to the consumer. In the United States regulatory milieu, this entails both the identification of key factors in a decision and the provision of consistent actions that would improve standing. The traditionally accepted approach to explainable credit risk modeling involves generating scores with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) - usually logistic regression, calculating the contribution of each predictor to the total points lost from the theoretical maximum, and generating reason codes based on the 4 or 5 most impactful predictors. The industry standard approach is not directly applicable to a more expressive and flexible class of nonlinear models known as neural networks. This paper demonstrates that an eXplainable AI (XAI) variable attribution technique known as Integrated Gradients (IG) is a natural generalization of the industry standard to neural networks. We also discuss the unique semantics surrounding implementation details in this nonlinear context. While the primary purpose of this paper is to introduce IG to the credit industry and argue for its establishment as an industry standard, a secondary goal is to familiarize academia with the legislative constraints - including their historical and philosophical roots - and sketch the standard approach in the credit industry since there is a dearth of literature on the topic.",Credit Scoring | Explainable Artificial Intelligence | Fairness | Integrated Gradients | Machine Learning Deep Learning | Transparency | Trust,0,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Machine learning models, especially ensemble learning approaches, have shown substantial progress in the performance improvement of credit scoring. The Bagging ensemble approach improves the credit scoring performance by optimizing the prediction variance while boosting ensemble algorithms reduce the prediction error by controlling the prediction bias. In this study, we propose a hybrid ensemble method that combines the advantages of the Bagging ensemble strategy and boosting ensemble optimization pattern, which can well balance the tradeoff of variance-bias optimization. The proposed method considers XGBoost as a base learner, which ensures the low-bias prediction. Moreover, the Bagging strategy is introduced to train the base learner to prevent over-fitting in the proposed method. Besides, the Bagging-boosting ensemble algorithm is further assembled in a cascading way, making the proposed new hybrid ensemble algorithm a good solution to balance the tradeoff of variance bias for credit scoring. Experimental results on the Australian, German, Japanese, and Taiwan datasets show the proposed Bagging-cascading boosted decision tree provides a more accurate credit scoring result.",Bagging-cascading | boosting | Credit scoring | ensemble learning,0,0,,,NSFC,21YF1415900,National Natural Science Foundation of China

We show that quantum noise can improve fairness and develop an algorithm to check whether a (noisy) quantum machine learning model is fair. In particular, this algorithm can find bias kernels of quantum data (encoding individuals) during checking. These bias kernels generate infinitely many bias pairs for investigating the unfairness of the model.

When a financial institution wants to build a model to predict the default of credit applicants, the institution only has a known good/bad outcome loan status for the accepted applicants; this causes an inherent bias in the model. Reject inference is used to infer the good or bad loan status of credit applicants that were rejected by a financial institution. This paper presents a reject inference technique in which a semi-supervised framework is developed using a Naive Bayes model. The framework uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to incorporate rejected applicants into the parameter estimation of the model using a bootstrapping approach. The proposed method has an advantage over traditional reject inference methods because the rejected applicant data will participate in the estimation of the model parameters, thus avoiding the extrapolation problem.

The spiking classifier is a multiclass synaptic efficacy function-based leaky-integrate-fire neuron (Mc-SEFRON) classifier. As a first step, the SEFRON classifier for binary classification is extended to handle multiclass classification problems. Next, a new method is presented to transform the temporally distributed weights in a fully trained Mc-SEFRON classifier to shape functions in the feature space. A composite of these shape functions results in an interpretable classifier, namely, a directly interpretable multiclass additive model (DIMA). The interpretations of DIMA are also demonstrated using the multiclass Iris dataset. Further, the performances of both the Mc-SEFRON and DIMA classifiers are evaluated on ten benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and compared with the other state-of-the-art spiking neural classifiers. The performance study results show that Mc-SEFRON produces similar or better performances than other spiking neural classifiers with an added benefit of interpretability through DIMA. Furthermore, the minor differences in accuracies between Mc-SEFRON and DIMA indicate the reliability of the DIMA classifier. Finally, the Mc-SEFRON and DIMA are tested on three real-world credit scoring problems, and their performances are compared with state-of-the-art results using machine learning methods. The results clearly indicate that DIMA improves the classification accuracy by up to 12% over other interpretable classifiers indicating a better quality of interpretations on the highly imbalanced credit scoring datasets.",Additive model | credit scoring | interpretable classifier | knowledge transform | spiking neural network | time-varying weight model,1,0,,,,undefined,

Advanced analytics can predict the probability that an event will happen and has been applied to pressing industry issues, such as credit scoring, risk management, and default management. Although little research has applied such technique for lot sizing problems, we observe that advanced analytics can uncover optimal patterns of setup variables given properties associated with the problems, such as problem attributes, and solution values yielded by linear programming relaxation, column generation, and Lagrangian relaxation. We, therefore, build advanced analytics models that yield information about how likely a solution pattern is the same as the optimum, which is insightful information used to partition the solution space into incumbent, superincumbent, and nonincumbent regions where an analytics-driven heuristic search procedure is applied to build restricted subproblems. These subproblems are solved by a combined mathematical programming technique to improve solution quality iteratively. We prove that the predictive search method can converge to the global optimal solution point.

We can only observe default/non-default labels for approved samples but have no observations for rejected samples, which leads to missing-not-at-random selection bias. Machine learning models trained on such biased data are inevitably unreliable. In this work, we find that the default/non-default classification task and the rejection/approval classification task are highly correlated, according to both real-world data study and theoretical analysis. Consequently, the learning of default/non-default can benefit from rejection/approval. Accordingly, we for the first time propose to model the biased credit scoring data with Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Specifically, we propose a novel Reject-aware Multi-Task Network (RMT-Net), which learns the task weights that control the information sharing from the rejection/approval task to the default/non-default task by a gating network based on rejection probabilities. RMT-Net leverages the relation between the two tasks that the larger the rejection probability, the more the default/non-default task needs to learn from the rejection/approval task. Furthermore, we extend RMT-Net to RMT-Net++ for modeling scenarios with multiple rejection/approval strategies. Extensive experiments are conducted on several datasets, and strongly verifies the effectiveness of RMT-Net on both approved and rejected samples. In addition, RMT-Net++ further improves RMT-Net's performances.",Biological system modeling | Computational modeling | Credit scoring | Data models | default prediction | missing-not-at-random | multi-task learning | Multitasking | reject inference | Support vector machines | Task analysis | Training,2,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Most machine learning and deep learning models are prone to unintended bias and discrimination in the datasets. Therefore, it is imperative to explain each prediction from the models during the scoring process to avoid the element of model bias and discrimination. Our study proposes a novel optimization formulation that generates sparse counterfactual explanations via a custom genetic algorithm to explain the black-box model's predictions.

Many of these applications suffer from the problem of Imbalanced data classification wherein one class consists of a large number of samples while samples representing another class are very less in number. The skewed nature of data results in the imprecise classification of the data which may be very harmful in some disciplines like medical applications.

With the advancement of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods, especially ensemble learning methods, have become increasingly popular for credit scoring. However, the problems of imbalanced data distribution and underutilized feature information have not been well addressed sufficiently. To make the credit scoring model more adaptable to imbalanced datasets, the original model-based synthetic sampling method is extended herein to balance the datasets by generating appropriate minority samples to alleviate class overlap. To enable the credit scoring model to extract inherent correlations from features, a new bagging-based feature transformation method is proposed, which transforms features using a tree-based algorithm and selects features using the chi-square statistic. Furthermore, a two-layer ensemble method that combines the advantages of dynamic ensemble selection and stacking is proposed to improve the classification performance of the proposed multi-stage ensemble model. Finally, four standardized datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model using six evaluation metrics.

First, a novel feature selection combined method based on a genetic algorithm (FSCM-GA) is proposed, in which different classifiers are used to select features in combination with a genetic algorithm and combine them to generate an optimal feature subset. Furthermore, an enhanced voting method (EVM) is proposed to integrate classifiers, with the aim of improving the classification results in which the prediction probability values are close to the threshold.

Researchers have developed complex credit scoring models using statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help banks and financial institutions to support their financial decisions. Neural networks are considered as a mostly wide used technique in finance and business applications. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to help bank management in scoring credit card clients using machine learning by modelling and predicting the consumer behaviour with respect to two aspects: the probability of single and consecutive missed payments for credit card customers. The proposed model is based on the bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to give the probability of a missed payment during the next month for each customer. The model was trained on a real credit card dataset and the customer behavioural scores are analysed using classical measures such as accuracy, Area Under the Curve, Brier score, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and H-measure. Calibration analysis of the LSTM model scores showed that they can be considered as probabilities of missed payments. The LSTM model was compared to four traditional machine learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, multi-layer perceptron neural network, and logistic regression.

In these problems, the ability to explain how the individual features and their interactions affect the decisions is as critical as model performance. Unfortunately, the existing ordinal regression models in the machine learning community aim at improving prediction accuracy rather than explore explainability. To achieve high accuracy while explaining the relationships between the features and the predictions, we propose a new method for ordinal regression problems, namely the Explainable Ordinal Factorization Model (XOFM). XOFM uses piecewise linear functions to approximate the shape functions of individual features, and renders the pairwise features interaction effects as heat-maps. The proposed XOFM captures the nonlinearity in the main effects and ensures the interaction effects' same flexibility. Therefore, the underlying model yields comparable performance while remaining explainable by explicitly describing the main and interaction effects. To address the potential sparsity problem caused by discretizing the whole feature scale into several sub-intervals, XOFM integrates the Factorization Machines (FMs) to factorize the model parameters. Comprehensive experiments with benchmark real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed XOFM leads to state-of-the-art prediction performance while preserving an easy-to-understand explainability.",decision support | explainable machine learning | factorization machines | Ordinal regression,2,0,,,NSFC,MHP/081/19,National Natural Science Foundation of China

MeST is developed to handle the class imbalance in classification problems without any data preprocessing methods. Meta-neuron based learning algorithm in MeST uses normalized postsynaptic potentials (global information) and weight of the connection (local information) to determine the sensitivity modulation factor. This modulation factor determines the proportion of the weight update for a given set of presynaptic spikes. The weight update is then embedded in a Gaussian function to determine the time-varying weight update. The centre of the time-varying Gaussian function is determined by the presynaptic spike times. MeST is demonstrated on 10 benchmark datasets from the University of California, Irvine California machine learning repository and then applied to solve credit scoring using three real-world datasets. Performance studies show that the generalization ability of MeST is better than other spiking neural networks with constant weight model, despite having a simple architecture. Furthermore, compared to other non-spiking shallow machine learning classifiers, MeST is a slightly better model for classification using highly imbalanced datasets. This indicates the learnability of a stand-alone classifier on an imbalanced dataset can be increased by using time-varying weights.",Class imbalance | Credit scoring | Spiking neural network | Supervised learning | Time-varying weight model,3,0,,,A*STAR,undefined,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research"

Although credit scoring has drawn much research interest and the superiority of ensemble models over single machine learning models has been proven, the question of which ensemble model is the best discrimination method for Chinese P2P lending services has received little attention. This study aims to conduct credit scoring by focusing on a Chinese P2P lending platform and selecting the optimal subset of features in order to find the best overall ensemble model. We propose a hybrid system to achieve these goals. Three feature selection algorithms are employed and combined to obtain the top 10 features. Six ensemble models with five base classifiers are then used to conduct comparisons after synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) treatment of the imbalanced data set. A real-world data set of 33 966 loans from the largest lending platform in China (ie, the Renren lending platform) is used to evaluate performance. The results show that the top 10 selected features can greatly improve performance compared with all features, particularly in terms of discriminating “bad” loans from “good” loans. Moreover, comparing the standard evaluations, robustness tests and statistical tests suggests that the gradient boosting decision tree, random forest and rotation forest methods are the best. Our findings can help risk managers and investors by providing them with correct warning signals and the main factors influencing “bad” loans, so that they can take corrective actions and reduce risk.",Chinese peer-to-peer (P2P) lending | credit scoring | ensemble learning | feature selection | synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) treatment,0,0,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,71774047,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Traditionally CSM is built by logit model or decision tree algorithm in financial companies, and in recent studies CSM has been integrated with machine learning algorithms such as random forest and gradient boosting to process a number of complex attributes of customer borrowers. On the other hand, CSM has been facing a critical challenge - the domain adaptation of customer borrowers. For domain adaptation problem, transfer learning techniques are generally utilized, however, it is quite difficult to execute precise predictions for unknown domain datasets in CSM because the distributions of labels could be different depending on the characteristics of domains. Therefore, there is no appropriate transfer learning method to solve domain adaptation problem in credit scoring. In this paper we propose a comprehensive transfer learning framework using Bayesian network to extract useful knowledge based on probability distributions to predict probability of default of customer borrowers more precisely than existing machine learning and transfer learning methods.

Wide opportunities for AI are seen in tasks associated with credit scoring. However, the expected potential and benefits of AI-based credit scoring and the overall path to digitalised lending could be challenged by the fact that a relatively large number of SMEs in Europe are credit invisible due to their financing patterns, that limit the availability of credit history and other creditworthiness sensitive data needed to build and train AI models. The research aims to estimate the nature and availability of credit scoring relevant SMEs data in different European countries. Research methods respective to the above-stated aim are the following: scientific literature review, descriptive, and country to country comparative analysis of the data from the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE). The survey data indicate that the share of credit invisible SMEs changes in the range of 1030%, but there is no direct relationship with the characteristics of the country. The initiatives to score the creditworthiness of SMEs should consider the share of SMEs that do not use services of the traditional financing sector, which means that data about its creditworthiness are limited. The whole population of SMEs could be covered by AI models incorporating both conventional financial data from credit visible SMEs processed by machine learning as well as unstructured non-financial data (describing credit invisible SMEs) processed by deep learning techniques and methods. Thus, we claim that despite the huge potential of AI incorporation into creditworthiness evaluation, the use of AI is not a magic pill, enhancing easier SME's access to finance, unless its use is aligned to the available data. Accordingly to the accessible data, different AI tools and techniques should be applied in credit scoring applications.",artificial intelligence | creditworthiness | digital lending | SMEs credit scoring,1,0,,,,undefined,

Given the advantages that AI brings to finance, we focused on applying supervised machine learning to an investment problem. 10-K SEC filings are routinely used by investors to determine the worth and status of a company–Warren Buffett is frequently cited to read a 10-K a day. We sought to answer–“Can machine learning analyze more than thousands of companies and spot patterns? Can machine learning automate the process of human analysis in predicting whether a company is fit to merge? Can machine learning spot something that humans cannot?” In the advent of rising antitrust discussion of growing market concentrations and the concern for decrease in competition, we analyzed merger activity using text as a data set. Merger activity has been traditionally hard to predict in the past. We took advantage of the large amount of publicly available filings through the Securities Exchange Commission that give a comprehensive summary of a company, and used text, and an innovative way to analyze a company. In order to verify existing theory and measure harder to observe variables, we look to use a text document and examined a firm’s 10-K SEC filing. To minimize over-fitting, the L2 LASSO regularization technique is used. We came up with a model that has 85% accuracy compared to a 35% accuracy using the “bag-of-words” method to predict a company’s likelihood of merging from words alone on the same period’s test data set. These steps are the beginnings of tackling more complicated questions, such as “Which section or topic of words is the most predictive?” and “What is the difference between being acquired and acquiring?” Using product descriptions to characterize mergers further into horizontal and vertical mergers could eventually assist with the causal estimates that are of interest to economists. More importantly, using language and words to categorize companies could be useful in predicting counterfactual scenarios and answering policy questions, and could have different applications ranging from detecting fraud to better trading.",finance | machine learning | mergers and acquisations | supervised training | text,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

In particular, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm allows experts to create one or more clustering scenarios regarding the features by defining a desired number of clusters per scenario. For each clustering scenario, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is applied for helping experts to make preferences for features of each cluster, set pair-wise constraints for features of equal importance, and evaluate their subjective judgments in terms of consistency.

Various machine learning techniques have been applied to the prediction of default in the past few decades. In this paper, we aim to capture those early defaulted borrowers who are likely to be fraudsters on the online lending platform by using a multi-layer structured Gradient Boosted Decision Trees with Light Gradient Boosting Machines (ML-LightGBM). Due to the extremely imbalanced sample distribution and the costs of misclassification, we further apply a cost-sensitive framework to the loss function of classification models, in order to improve predictive accuracy. The empirical results, based on a sample of 1.6 million online loans, show that the proposed cost-sensitive ML-LightGBM algorithm outperforms other predictive models.

Yet, inevitably costs are involved with delegating power to algorithmically based systems, some of whose workings are opaque and unobservable and thus termed the “black box”. Central to understanding the “black box” is to acknowledge that the algorithm is not mendaciously undertaking this action; it is simply using the recombination afforded to scaled computable machine learning algorithms. But an algorithm with arbitrary precision can easily reconstruct those characteristics and make life-changing decisions, particularly in financial services (credit scoring, risk assessment, etc.), and it could be difficult to reconstruct, if this was done in a fair manner reflecting the values of society. If we permit AI to make life-changing decisions, what are the opportunity costs, data trade-offs, and implications for social, economic, technical, legal, and environmental systems? We find that over 160 ethical AI principles exist, advocating organisations to act responsibly to avoid causing digital societal harms. This maelstrom of guidance, none of which is compulsory, serves to confuse, as opposed to guide. We need to think carefully about how we implement these algorithms, the delegation of decisions and data usage, in the absence of human oversight and AI governance.

Such clients may be considered “noisy” as their eventual belonging to the defaulters class results rather from random factors than from some predictable rules. Excluding such clients from the dataset may be helpful in building more accurate predictive models. In this paper, we report on primary results on testing the hypothesis that a client can become a defaulter in two scenarios: intentionally and unintentionally. We verify our hypothesis applying data driven regularized classification using an autoencoder to client profiles. To model an intention as a hidden variable, we propose an especially designed regularizer for the autoencoder. The regularizer aims to obtain a representation of defaulters that includes a cluster of intentional defaulters and unintentional defaulters as outliers. The outliers were detected by our model and excluded from the dataset. This improved the credit scoring model and confirmed our hypothesis.",Autoencoder | Clustering | Credit scoring | Defaulters | Machine learning | Neural networks | Regularization | Transaction profiling,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,RSF,17-71-30029,Russian Science Foundation

A credit score is a numerical quantity that can be qualified by a rating label showing the potential risk. In order to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue at the exact interest rate and credit limits, the lenders take into accounts these credit scores. In this context, the robust statistical models are inevitable to reduce the number of wrong decisions in the credit evaluation process. Although the machine learning approaches provide superior performance to conventional statistical methods, they are mostly criticized due to the selection of model structure, model complexity, tuning parameters, time consumption in the high-dimensional and excessive nonlinear cases. For this reason, this study introduces an efficient model estimation and feature selection procedure for artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers in the context of credit scoring. Essentially, this procedure hybridizes training of ANNs with a novel feature selection approach based on genetic algorithms and information complexity criterion. In the application, the proposed procedure was performed on a couple of benchmark credit scoring datasets. According to analysis results, the proposed approach not only estimates robust models from ANNs in terms of model complexity, feature selection, and time consumption, but also outperforms the traditional training procedure for the classification accuracies, false positive, and false negative errors overtraining and test datasets.",artificial neural networks | credit scoring | feature selection | genetic algorithms | ICOMP | information complexity,5,0,,,,2018‐31,

In particular, the growing reliance on consumers’ personal data by lenders due to algorithmic credit scoring, coupled with the ineffectiveness of existing data protection remedies has created a data protection gap in consumer credit markets that presents a significant threat to consumer privacy and autonomy.

To reduce the adverse effects of outliers existing in the noise-filled credit datasets, a local outlier factor algorithm is enhanced with the bagging strategy to effectively identify outliers and subsequently boost them back into the training set to construct an outlier-adapted training set that enhances the outlier adaptability of base classifiers. To improve the feature interpretability, a new dimension-reduced feature transformation method is proposed to hierarchically evolve features and extract salient features. To further strengthen the predictive power of the proposed model, a stacking-based ensemble learning method with self-adaptive parameter optimization is proposed to optimize the parameters of selected base classifiers automatically and then to construct a stacking-based multi-stage ensemble model. Ten datasets are tested with six evaluation indicators to evaluate the performance of the proposed model.

The balance optimization subset selection problem, which formulates minimization of aggregate imbalance in covariate distributions to reduce bias in data, is a new area of study in operations research. We investigate a novel metric, cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of balance between treatment and control groups. The proposed approach provides direct and automatic balancing of covariate distributions. In addition, the AUC-based approach is able to detect subtler distributional differences than existing measures, such as simple empirical mean/variance and count-based metrics. Thus, optimizing AUCs achieves a greater balance than the existing methods. Using 5 widely used real data sets and 7 synthetic data sets, we show that optimization of samples using existing methods (Chi-square, mean variance differences, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, and Mahalanobis) results in samples containing imbalance that is detectable using machine learning ensembles. We minimize covariate imbalance by minimizing the absolute value of the distance of the maximum cross-validated AUC on M folds from 0.50, using evolutionary optimization. We demonstrate that particle swarm optimization (PSO) outperforms modified cuckoo swarm (MCS) for a gradient-free, non-linear noisy cost function. To compute AUCs, we use supervised binary classification approaches from the machine learning and credit scoring literature. Using superscore ensembles adds to the classifier-based two-sample testing literature.

Such technological developments from artificial intelligence (AI) labs have ushered concomitant applications across the world of business, where an “AI” brand-tag is quickly becoming ubiquitous. A corollary of such widespread commercial deployment is that when AI gets things wrong—an autonomous vehicle crashes, a chatbot exhibits “racist” behavior, automated credit-scoring processes “discriminate” on gender, etc.—there are often significant financial, legal, and brand consequences, and the incident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for such mistakes is that “.. all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting.” The key, as Pearl suggests, is to replace “reasoning by association” with “causal reasoning” —the ability to infer causes from observed phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis in a recent piece for the New York Times: “we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets—often using an approach known as ‘Deep Learning’—and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space, and causality.” In this paper, foregrounding what in 1949 Gilbert Ryle termed “a category mistake”, I will offer an alternative explanation for AI errors; it is not so much that AI machinery cannot “grasp” causality, but that AI machinery (qua computation) cannot understand anything at all.",artificial intelligence | artificial neural networks | causal cognition | Chinese room argument | cognitive science | dancing with pixies | Penrose-Lucas argument,17,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

These decisions are made by applying a decision rule to individual's observed features. Given the impacts of these decisions on individuals, decision makers are increasingly required to be transparent on their decision making to offer the “right to explanation.” Meanwhile, being transparent also invites potential manipulations, also known as gaming, that individuals can utilize the knowledge to strategically alter their features in order to receive a more beneficial decision. In this work, we study the problem of robust decision-making under strategic behavior. Prior works often assume that the decision maker has full knowledge of individuals' cost structure for manipulations. We study the robust variant that relaxes this assumption: The decision maker does not have full knowledge but knows only a subset of the individuals' available actions and associated costs. To approach this non-quantifiable uncertainty, we define robustness based on the worst-case guarantee of a decision, over all possible actions (including actions unknown to the decision maker) individuals might take. A decision rule is called robust optimal if its worst case performance is (weakly) better than that of all other decision rules. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a crisp characterization of the above robust optimality: For any decision rules under mild conditions that are robust optimal, there exists a linear decision rule that is equally robust optimal. Second, we explore the computational problem of searching for the robust optimal decision rule and demonstrate its connection to distributionally robust optimization. We believe our results promote the use of simple linear decisions with uncertain individual manipulations.",,1,0,,,NSF,IIS-1939677,National Science Foundation

AI is one of the front digital transformation strategies which can spread in the area of finance today. The use of this AI can improve core banking operations and tailor services which in turn will deliver over $250 billion in value across the industry (According to the McKinsey Global Institute). The banking sector of India as a financial service have recognized the potential and prospects of AI and ML and therefore it is being applied in almost all activities of banking operations. Analysts and experts estimate that AI will save roughly $1 trillion of the banking industry by 2030 [3]. According to Narrative Science, 32% of the participating banks in their 2018 report are already incorporating predictive analytics, recommendation engines, voice recognition and response times in their processes. ML is just a subset of AI which helps banks in bringing several benefits through analyzing mounds of financial data. Nowadays the traditional banking business is undergoing an exciting period of disruption, and at the same time it is evident from the 21st century that the worldwide banking sector is becoming digitalized as the trend spreads across the globe. Due to enormous changes with customer preferences, all industries now, including the banking sector, are adopting innovative methods to match the pace with changing demand and AI, ML and robotics are few among them. AI and ML impacts are clearly manifested in many areas of banking sector like credit scoring, creditworthiness, personal assistance, market research, fraud detection and asset management etc. AI is rapidly reshaping the business landscape of the financial industry including the banking industry. Banks should implement the AI technology in order to become more relevant and competitive, to provide personalized experience to customers, to improve and enhance the profit margin and to survive in the market amongst cutthroat competition. With the numerous available relevant technologies, application of AI and have deeply penetrated the banking sector and it is not only modernizing but also transforming this sector into a new horizon. Through the use of AI and ML the banks are leveraging the benefits of reduction in human error, strengthening customer base, reducing fraud, enhancing security and defence through utilizing knowledge data base and also controlling risk through minimizing credit score of customers. Nowadays, operation of banks is becoming more methodical and AI and ML have metamorphose every aspect of banking sector and has made its process faster. There are so many digital platforms used under AI and ML which are helpful to the banks for doing their business and operation smoothly. Some of them are handy while handling customer service, detection of fraud, creation of facial bio metrics and others are generous for computing the credit score and handling the customer queries. Few of these techniques used by the banks especially under AI are KASISTO (KAI), PEPPER, HooYu, DATAVISOR. PLAID and ZESTFINANCE etc. which prove to be, crucial for the banking sector for their glossy performance. So, it can be concluded form the study that in the banking sector the application and adoption of AI and ML enhances efficiency, increases profitability, serve customers more efficiently, offers data insights and manages risk of banks.

One of the main reasons for the collapse was the high default rates of low-income security loans. Calculating credit scores can be a complicated process for people with thin credit histories or non-existent credit histories. Banks may refuse to give loans if the scores don't satisfy their requirements. Lack of a credit score is considered as an indicator for potential default and hence banks avoid sanctioning loans for people who come under this category. However, banks still offer loans if people are willing to offer securities. Credit Scoring can be done by using state-of-The-Art Machine Learning models. Machine Learning and Data Science are becoming increasingly crucial in the fin-Tech world. Popular machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Linear Support Vector Machines are being used currently. We're looking to explore further into credit risk analysis with LightGBM as our algorithm of choice. It is an open source framework developed by Microsoft in 2017. It is an ensemble model which has several advantages such as better prediction and higher stability.

Due to the serious consequence of borrowers' breach of contract, banks need a valid method to help managing credit risk. Till now, the most common way is to set up blacklist and whitelist according to previous loan records to assist bank in deciding whether to offer loan to someone or not. In other words, there is a fixed threshold to filter customers. Once borrower has a number of violations beyond the threshold, the bank will add him into the blacklist which means the man cannot get debt in the future according to his poor credit. This simple method may be useful but it also has some inevitable downsides resulting from its empirical nature. For instance, this approach still needs to be conducted with countless bank workers, accounting for its failure in satisfying soaring need in current changeable loan scenario. Meanwhile, the manually set threshold is not sensitive to massive data, which is more than unavoidable in today's life. To the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods are suitable to deal with huge amount of data and make accurate predictions. Considering the characteristics in consumer lending and trust loan, we put forward a new algorithm model implemented with machine learning knowledge to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. The method contains some cutting-edge machine learning ideas such as tree model and neural network. This new credit scoring framework can solve above problems effectively and control the expenditure within an acceptable range. In the experiments, we evaluate our method extensively on bank credit dataset, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms most credit scoring and risk prediction methods, achieving an AUC of 0.840 on the Test Set.",algorithm model | credit risk management | financial technology | machine learning | risk prediction,0,0,,,,undefined,

To increase the degree of objectivity, the paper discusses an approach to assessing the responsibility and solvency of microloan borrowers, based on the use of the fuzzy maxmin convolution method of multi-criteria choice of alternatives under uncertainty. Taking into account the weakly structured personal data of applicants this approach allows them to be flexibly and promptly assessed for microcredits. The applied qualitative criteria of assessment are weighed on the base of agreed expert opinions relative to priority of each of them. An important advantage of the applied model is that it is simple, convenient to use and able to adapt to the requirements of various commercial banks and micro-financial organizations.

However, acclaimed contemporary credit risk measures such as the scores provided by FICO or Vantage are not publicly accessible. This paper addresses the problem of developing an alternative credit scoring measure that approximates the behavior of the original FICO score in a large-scale collection of loan-related data available from Lending Club. The severity of the underlying problem is manifested by the limited amount of knowledge which can be obtained for both the exact analytical formula and the complete set of credit-specific features that underpin the computation of FICO score. The proposed measure will be derived by exploiting a limited amount of entry-level information submitted by each candidate borrower without requiring the accumulation of historical credit data for each consumer over large periods of time. We are particularly interested in expressing the acquired credit risk measure in a closed analytical form of adjustable complexity. For this purpose, we utilize a symbolic regression technique which operates within the framework of Genetic Programming (GP). In this context, we harness the notion of Occam's razor to apply evolutionary pressure towards the preservation of models associated with reduced complexity and higher degree of human interpretability. In order to verify the validity of our approach we compare the approximation ability of the GP-based symbolic regression against state-of-the-art machine learning-based regression methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs). Our experimentation demonstrates that GP-based symbolic regression achieves comparable accuracy with respect to the aforementioned benchmark techniques. At the same time, the acquired analytical model can provide valuable insights concerning the credit risk assessment mechanisms that underlie the computation of FICO based on a significantly reduced set of credit-related features.",Credit Risk Assessment | Genetic Programming | Neural Networks | Radial Basis Functions Networks | Support Vector Machines,0,0,,,,undefined,

In this work, we propose a cost sensitive credit scoring system, based on a two-step process. The first is a resampling step which handles the imbalance data problem followed by a cost sensitive classification step that recognises potential insolvent loans red in order to reduce financial loss. A resampling algorithm called ensemble margin for imbalanced instance (EM2I) is suggested to manage imbalanced datasets in cost sensitive learning.

Firstly, according to the application scenario of credit evaluation of personal credit data, the experimental dataset is cleaned, the discrete data is one-HOT coded, and the data are standardized. Due to the high dimension of personal credit data, the pdC-RF algorithm is adopted in this paper to optimize the correlation of data features and reduce the 145-dimensional data to 22-dimensional data. On this basis, WOE coding was carried out on the dataset, which was applied to random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression models, and the performance was compared.

To alleviate the adverse effects of imbalanced data in credit scoring models, the Instance Hardness Threshold method is extended using a majority voting strategy to deal with data imbalance. To eliminate redundant and irrelevant features in the dataset and select well-performing base classifiers, a new hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal feature subset and base classifier subset. To aggregate the predictive power of the base classifiers, a stacking approach is adopted to integrate the optimal base classifiers into the ensemble model. The proposed model is tested on three standard imbalanced credit scoring datasets, compared with similar state-of-the-art approaches, and evaluated using four well-known evaluation indicators.

However, given the high-performance overhead of HE, financial institutions —whose processing rate requirements are stringent— are more oriented towards TEE-based solutions.

The credit scoring model represented by machine learning methods such as deep learning performs well in terms of the accuracy of default discrimination, but the model itself also has many shortcomings such as many hyperparameters and large dependence on big data. There is still a lot of room to improve its interpretability and robustness. Methods: the deep forest or multi-Grained Cascade Forest (gcForest) is a decision tree depth model based on the random forest algorithm. Using multidimensional scanning and cascading processing, gcForest can effectively identify and process high-dimensional feature information. At the same time, gcForest has fewer hyperparameters and has strong robustness. So, this paper constructs a two-stage hybrid default discrimination model based on multiple feature selection methods and gcForest algorithm, and at the same time, it optimizes the parameters for the lowest type II error as the first principle, and the highest AUC and accuracy as the second and third principles. GcForest can not only reflect the advantages of traditional statistical models in terms of interpretability and robustness but also take into account the advantages of deep learning models in terms of accuracy. Results: the validity of the hybrid default discrimination model is verified by three real open credit data sets of Australian, Japanese, and German in the UCI database. Conclusion: the performance of the gcForest is better than the current popular single classifiers such as ANN, and the common ensemble classifiers such as LightGBM, and CNNs in type II error, AUC, and accuracy.

In recent years, research has shown that machine learning has satisfactory performance in credit scoring. Because of the advantages of feature combination and feature selection, decision trees can match credit data which have high dimension and a complex correlation. Decision trees tend to overfitting yet. eXtreme Gradient Boosting is an advanced gradient enhanced tree that overcomes its shortcomings by integrating tree models. The structure of the model is determined by hyperparameters, which is aimed at the time-consuming and laborious problem of manual tuning, and the optimization method is employed for tuning. As particle swarm optimization describes the particle state and its motion law as continuous real numbers, the hyperparameter applicable to eXtreme Gradient Boosting can find its optimal value in the continuous search space. However, classical particle swarm optimization tends to fall into local optima. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an eXtreme Gradient Boosting credit scoring model that is based on adaptive particle swarm optimization. The swarm split, which is based on the clustering idea and two kinds of learning strategies, is employed to guide the particles to improve the diversity of the subswarms, in order to prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. In the experiment, several traditional machine learning algorithms and popular ensemble learning classifiers, as well as four hyperparameter optimization methods (grid search, random search, treestructured Parzen estimator, and particle swarm optimization), are considered for comparison. Experiments were performed with four credit datasets and seven KEEL benchmark datasets over five popular evaluation measures: Accuracy, error rate (type I error and type II error), Brier score, and F1 score.

Copying is a technique that allows differential replication by projecting a given classifier onto a new hypothesis space, in circumstances where access to both the original solution and its training data is limited. The resulting model replicates the original decision behavior while displaying new features and characteristics. In this paper, we apply this approach to a use case in the context of credit scoring. We use a private residential mortgage default dataset. We show that differential replication through copying can be exploited to adapt a given solution to the changing demands of a constrained environment such as that of the financial market. In particular, we show how copying can be used to replicate the decision behavior not only of a model, but also of a full pipeline. As a result, we can ensure the decomposability of the attributes used to provide explanations for credit scoring models and reduce the time-to-market delivery of these solutions.",Copying | Credit scoring | Differential replication | Environmental adaptation,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,AGAUR,2017-DI-25,Generalitat de Catalunya

Over the years, statistical and classical machine learning models have been the most researched risk management tools in credit scoring literature, and recently the focus has turned to deep learning models. This transition is due to better performances that are shown by deep learning models in different domains. Despite deep learning models' superior performances, there is still a need for explaining how these models make their predictions. The non-transparency nature of deep learning models has created a bottleneck for their use in credit scoring. Explanations of decisions are important for lending institutions since it is a requirement for automated decisions that are generated by non-transparent models to be explained. The other issue in using deep learning models, specifically 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in credit scoring is the need to have the data in image format. We propose an explainable deep learning model for credit scoring which can harness the performance benefits offered by deep learning and yet comply with the legislation requirements for the automated decision-making processes. The proposed method converts tabular datasets into images and thus allowing the application of 2D CNNs in credit scoring. Each pixel of the image corresponds to a feature bin of the tabular dataset. The predictions from the 2D CNNs were explained using state-of-the-art explanation methods. Furthermore, explanations were evaluated using a sanity check methodology and also performances of the explanation methods were compared quantitatively. The proposed explainable deep learning model outperforms the other credit scoring methods on publicly available credit scoring datasets.",convolutional neural network | Credit scoring | deep learning | explainable artificial intelligence,15,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Therefore, to go some way to filling this research gap, this study developed a new deep learning ensemble credit risk evaluation model to deal with imbalanced credit data. First, an improved synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) method was developed to overcome known SMOTE shortcomings, after which a new deep learning ensemble classification method combined with the long-short-term-memory (LSTM) network and the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm was developed to train and learn the processed credit data. Then, area under the curve (AUC), the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) and the non-parametric Wilcoxon test were employed to compare the performance of the proposed model and other widely used credit scoring models on two imbalanced credit datasets.

Without alternative data, the type of data that is typically available is demographic data. We show that a model that contains email usage and psychometric variables, as well as demographic variables, can give greater predictive accuracy than a model that uses demographic data only and that the predictive accuracy is sufficiently high for the demographic and email data to be used when conventional credit history data is unavailable. The same applies if merely psychometric data is included together with demographic data. However, we show that different randomly selected training: test sample splits give a wide range of predictive accuracies. In the second part of the paper, using two datasets that include only email usage as a predictor, we compare the predictive performances of a wide range of machine learning and statistical classifiers.

In this paper, we made 3 anonymized real-world credit scoring datasets available alongside the results obtained. In each of these datasets, we verify whether the credit scoring task should be thought as an ephemeral scenario since many of the variables may drift over time, and thus, data stream mining techniques should be used since they were tailored for incremental learning and to detect and adapt to changes in the data distribution. Therefore, we compare both traditional batch machine learning algorithms with data stream algorithms in different validation schemes using both Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Population Stability Index metrics.

However, advanced tree-based classifiers have been seldom utilized as components of ensemble models. Moreover, few studies have considered dynamic ensemble selection. To fill the research gap, this paper aims to develop a novel tree-based overfitting-cautious heterogeneous ensemble model (i.e., OCHE) for credit scoring which departs from existing literature on base models and ensemble selection strategy. Regarding base models, tree-based techniques are employed to acquire a balance between predictive accuracy and computational cost. In terms of ensemble selection, the proposed method can assign weights to base models dynamically according to the overfitting measure. Validated on five public datasets, the proposed approach is compared with several popular benchmark models and selection strategies on predictive accuracy and computational cost measures. For predictive accuracy, the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark models significantly in most cases based on the non-parametric significance test. It also performs marginally better than several state-of-the-art studies. Our proposal remains robust in several scenarios. In terms of computational cost, the proposed method provides acceptable performance and benefits from GPU acceleration considerably.",Credit scoring | Gradient boosting decision tree | Machine learning | Random forests | Selective ensemble,47,0,,,NSFC,201910320057,National Natural Science Foundation of China

While decisions were previously based on human expertise, they are now increasingly relying on data analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we assess the ability of state-of-the-art adversarial machine learning to craft attacks on a real-world credit scoring system. Interestingly, we find that, while these techniques can generate large numbers of adversarial data, these are practically useless as they all violate domain-specific constraints. In other words, the generated examples are all false positives as they cannot occur in practice. To circumvent this limitation, we propose CoEvA2, a search-based method that generates valid adversarial examples (satisfying the domain constraints). CoEvA2 utilizes multi-objective search in order to simultaneously handle constraints, perform the attack and maximize the overdraft amount requested. We evaluate CoEvA2 on a major bank's real-world system by checking its ability to craft valid attacks. CoEvA2 generates thousands of valid adversarial examples, revealing a high risk for the banking system. Fortunately, by improving the system through adversarial training (based on the produced examples), we increase its robustness and make our attack fail.",Adversarial attacks | Credit Scoring | FinTech | Random Forest | Search-based,10,1,repositoryvor,Green,FNR,undefined,Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg

Moreover, ELM performance depends on activation function, weights and biases assigned to hidden neurons.

The present computational work focuses on building a credit scoring prediction model. A publicly available German credit data is incorporated in this study. An improvement in the credit scoring prediction has been shown with the use of different feature selection techniques (such as Information-gain, Gain-Ratio and Chi-Square) and machine learning classifiers (Bayesian, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree (C5.0) and SVM (support Vector Machine)). Further, a comparative analysis is performed between different machine learning classifiers and between different feature selection techniques. Different evaluation metrics are considered for analyzing performance of the models (such as accuracy, F-measure, false positive rate, false negative rate and training time). After analysis, a best combination of machine learning classifier and feature selection technique are identified. In this study, a combination of random forest (RF) and Chi-Square (CS) is found good, among other combinations, with respect to good performance accuracy, F-measure and low false positive and false negative rates. However, training time for this particular combination was found to be slightly higher. Result of C5.0 with chi-square was comparable with the best one.

Therefore, credit scoring assessments using artificial intelligence has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Successful machine learning methods can provide rapid analysis of credit scores while updating older ones on a daily time scale. Related studies have shown that neural networks and support vector machines outperform other techniques by providing better prediction accuracy. The purpose of this paper is two fold. First, we provide a survey and a comparative analysis of results from literature applying machine learning techniques to predict credit rating. Second, we apply ourselves four machine learning techniques deemed useful from previous studies (Bagged Decision Trees, Random Forest, support vector machine and Multilayer Perceptron) to the same datasets. We evaluate the results using a 10-fold cross validation technique. The results of the experiment for the datasets chosen show superior performance for decision tree based models. In addition to the conventional accuracy measure of classifiers, we introduce a measure of accuracy based on notches called ”Notch Distance” to analyze the performance of the above classifiers in the specific context of credit rating. This measure tells us how far the predictions are from the true ratings. We further compare the performance of three major rating agencies, Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch where we show that the difference in their ratings is comparable with the decision tree prediction versus the actual rating on the test dataset.",Classification trees | Credit rating | Machine learning models | Neural networks | Support vector machine,30,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

All single and ensemble classifier-based models were evaluated using four of the most used performance metrics for assessing financial stress models. From the comparison analysis between, with, and without applying the feature selection and across the three credit datasets, the Random-Forest + Information-Gain model achieved a better trade-off in improving the model's accuracy rate with the value of 96% for the Australian credit dataset. This model also obtained the lowest Type I error with the value of 4% for the German credit dataset, the lowest Type II error with the value of 2% for the German credit dataset and the highest value of G-mean of 95% for the Australian credit dataset. The results clearly indicate that the Random-Forest + Information-Gain model is an excellent predictor for the credit risk cases.",Credit risk assessment | Credit scoring prediction | Ensemble classifiers | Feature selection techniques | Machine learning in credit risk assessment | Single classifiers,0,0,,,PNU,undefined,Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University

Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are the Artificial Intelligence techniques that have been attracting interest due to their flexibility to account for various data patterns. Both are black-box models which are sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Feature selection can be performed on SVM to enable explanation with the reduced features, whereas feature importance computed by RF can be used for model explanation. The benefits of accuracy and interpretation allow for significant improvement in the area of credit risk and credit scoring. This paper proposes the use of Harmony Search (HS), to form a hybrid HS-SVM to perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning simultaneously, and a hybrid HS-RF to tune the hyperparameters. A Modified HS (MHS) is also proposed with the main objective to achieve comparable results as the standard HS with a shorter computational time. MHS consists of four main modifications in the standard HS: (i) Elitism selection during memory consideration instead of random selection, (ii) dynamic exploration and exploitation operators in place of the original static operators, (iii) a self-adjusted bandwidth operator, and (iv) inclusion of additional termination criteria to reach faster convergence. Along with parallel computing, MHS effectively reduces the computational time of the proposed hybrid models. The proposed hybrid models are compared with standard statistical models across three different datasets commonly used in credit scoring studies. The computational results show that MHS-RF is most robust in terms of model performance, model explainability and computational time.",Artificial intelligence | Credit scoring | Feature selection | Harmony search | Hyperparameter tuning | Random forest | Support vector machines,10,1,repositoryam,Green,,GP-IPS/2018/9646000,Universiti Putra Malaysia

The profitability of the banks thus highly depends on the models used to decide on the customer's loans. State-of-the-art credit scoring models are based on machine learning and statistical methods. One of the major problems of this field is that lenders often deal with imbalanced datasets that usually contain many paid loans but very few not paid ones (called defaults). Recently, dynamic selection methods combined with ensemble methods and preprocessing techniques have been evaluated to improve classification models in imbalanced datasets presenting advantages over the static machine learning methods. In a dynamic selection technique, samples in the neighborhood of each query sample are used to compute the local competence of each base classifier. Then, the technique selects only competent classifiers to predict the query sample. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of dynamic selection techniques for credit scoring problem, and we present Reduced Minority k-Nearest Neighbors (RMkNN), an approach that enhances state of the art in defining the local region of dynamic selection techniques for imbalanced credit scoring datasets. This proposed technique has a superior prediction performance in imbalanced credit scoring datasets compared to state of the art. Furthermore, RMkNN does not need any preprocessing or sampling method to generate the dynamic selection dataset (called DSEL). Additionally, we observe an equivalence between dynamic selection and static selection classification. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed technique against state-of-the-art competitors on six real-world public datasets and one private one. Experiments show that RMkNN improves the classification performance of the evaluated datasets regarding AUC, balanced accuracy, H-measure, G-mean, F-measure, and Recall.",Credit scoring | Dynamic Selection Classification | Imbalanced learning,39,0,repositoryam,Green,H2020,8789771/2017,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help us make evidence-driven, efficient decisions, but can also confront us with unjustified, discriminatory decisions wrongly assumed to be accurate because they are made automatically and quantitatively. It is becoming evident that these technological developments are consequential to people’s fundamental human rights. Despite increasing attention to these urgent challenges in recent years, technical solutions to these complex socio-ethical problems are often developed without empirical study of societal context and the critical input of societal stakeholders who are impacted by the technology. On the other hand, calls for more ethically and socially aware AI often fail to provide answers for how to proceed beyond stressing the importance of transparency, explainability, and fairness. Bridging these socio-technical gaps and the deep divide between abstract value language and design requirements is essential to facilitate nuanced, context-dependent design choices that will support moral and social values. In this paper, we bridge this divide through the framework of Design for Values, drawing on methodologies of Value Sensitive Design and Participatory Design to present a roadmap for proactively engaging societal stakeholders to translate fundamental human rights into context-dependent design requirements through a structured, inclusive, and transparent process.",Artificial intelligence | Design for Values | ethics | human rights | stakeholders | Value Sensitive Design,49,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Comparing with fuzzy logic, the decision analytic approach can more easily present the outcomes of the analysis. On the other hand, fuzzy logic makes some implicit assumptions that may make it even harder for credit-grantors to follow the logical decision-making process.

Hence, companies and banks are trying to use novel automated solutions to deal with CS challenge to protect their own finances and customers. Nowadays, different machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) algorithms have been used to improve various aspects of CS prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, named Deep Genetic Hierarchical Network of Learners (DGHNL). The proposed methodology comprises different types of learners, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), and fuzzy systems. The Statlog German (1000 instances) credit approval dataset available in the UCI machine learning repository is used to test the effectiveness of our model in the CS domain. Our DGHNL model encompasses five kinds of learners, two kinds of data normalization procedures, two extraction of features methods, three kinds of kernel functions, and three kinds of parameter optimizations. Furthermore, the model applies deep learning, ensemble learning, supervised training, layered learning, genetic selection of features (attributes), genetic optimization of learners parameters, and novel genetic layered training (selection of learners) approaches used along with the cross-validation (CV) training-testing method (stratified 10-fold). The novelty of our approach relies on a proper flow and fusion of information (DGHNL structure and its optimization). We show that the proposed DGHNL model with a 29-layer structure is capable to achieve the prediction accuracy of 94.60% (54 errors per 1000 classifications) for the Statlog German credit approval data. It is the best prediction performance for this well-known credit scoring dataset, compared to the existing work in the field.",Credit scoring | Data mining | Deep learning | Ensemble learning | Feature extraction and selection | Genetic algorithm | Machine learning,95,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Recent research has proposed several systems for improving credit rating. In this paper, a new scalable credit scoring multi-agent system called ""CSMAS"" is introduced for the prediction of problems in data mining of credit scoring domain. This engine is built using a seven-layer multi-agent system architecture to generate a data mining process based on the coordination of intelligent agents. CSMAS performance is based on preprocessing and data forecasting. The first layer is designed to retrieve any data from various core banking systems, payment systems, credit Bureaus and external databases and data sources and to store it in big data platform. The second layer is devoted to three different subtasks; feature engineering, pre-processing data and integrating diverse datasets. While the third layer is dedicated to dealing with missing Values and treating outliers. In the fourth layer, the techniques of dimensionality reduction are used to reduce the number of features in the original set of features. The fifth layer is dedicated to build a model using the new generation of Gradient Boosting Algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost) and make predictions. The sixth layer is designed for the model's evaluation. The seventh layer is made to perform the rating of new credit applicants. The performance of CSMAS is assessed using a large dataset of Home Credit Default Risk from Kaggle Challenge (307511 records) to evaluate the risk of a loan applicant as a major problem for banks. The results show that the CSMAS give relevant results. Therefore, the results indicated that the CSMAS can be further employed as a reliable tool to predict more complicated case in credit scoring.",Big Data | CatBoost | Credit Scoring | LightGBM | Multi-Agent System | XgBoost,5,0,,,,undefined,

Lately, the use of ADM systems across various fields, ranging from public to private, from criminal justice to credit scoring, has given rise to concerns about the negative consequences that data-driven technologies have in reinforcing and reinterpreting existing societal biases. This development has led to growing demand for ethical AI, often perceived to require human control over automation. By engaging in discussions of human-computer interaction and in post-structural policy analysis, I examine EU policy proposals to address the problematizations of AI through human oversight. I argue that the relevant policy documents do not reflect the results of earlier research which have undeniably demonstrated the shortcomings of human control over automation, which in turn leads to the reproduction of the harmful dichotomy of human versus machine in EU policy. Despite its shortcomings, the emphasis on human oversight reflects broader fears surrounding loss of control, framed as ethical concerns around digital technologies. Critical examination of these fears reveals an inherent connection between human agency and the legitimacy of legal decision-making that socio-legal scholarship needs to address.",AI ethics | Algorithmic governance | Automation | EU law | Human control | Legal theory | Oversight,19,0,,,,undefined,

This study introduces SSL, cost-sensitive learning, a group method of data handling (GMDH), and an ensemble learning technique to propose a GMDH-based cost-sensitive semi-supervised selective ensemble (GCSSE) model. This involves two stages: (1)First, train an ensemble model composed of N base classifiers on the initial training set L with class labels, use it to selectively label the samples from the dataset U without class labels, add them with their predicted labels to the training set, and update the N base classifiers on the new training set; (2)Second, classify L and the test set using the respective trained base classifiers, and construct a cost-sensitive GMDH neural network to obtain the selective ensemble classification results for the test set.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and surface are useful tools to assess the ability of diagnostic tests to discriminate between ordered classes or groups.

One procedure that is commonly used to find the optimal thresholds is by maximizing what is known as Youden’s index. This article presents nonparametric predictive inference (NPI) for selecting the optimal thresholds of a diagnostic test. NPI is a frequentist statistical method that is explicitly aimed at using few modeling assumptions, enabled through the use of lower and upper probabilities to quantify uncertainty. Based on multiple future observations, the NPI approach is presented for selecting the optimal thresholds for two-group and three-group scenarios. In addition, a pairwise approach has also been presented for the three-group scenario. The article ends with an example to illustrate the proposed methods and a simulation study of the predictive performance of the proposed methods along with some classical methods such as Youden index.

Using these models in P2P Lending have limitations. First, the credit data of P2P usually contains dense numerical features and sparse categorical features. Second, the existing credit scoring models are generally cannot be updated online. The loan transaction of P2P lending is very frequent and the new data leads data distribution to change. A credit scoring model without considering data update causes a serious deviation or even failure in subsequent credit assessment. In this paper, we propose a new online integrated credit scoring model (OICSM) for P2P Lending. OICSM integrates gradient boosting decision tree and neural network to make the credit scoring model can handle two types of features more effectively and update online. Offline and online experiments based on real and representative credit datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that OICSM can significantly improve performance due to its advantage in deep learning over two features, and it can further correct model deterioration due to its online dynamic update capability.",Credit scoring model | Deep learning | Machine learning | Online P2P lending | Online update,15,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,16ZDB52,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Therefore, the use of different machine learning solutions to that task has been growing during the past recent years. Such procedures have been used in order to identify customers who are reliable or unreliable, with the intention to counterbalance financial losses due to loans offered to wrong customer profiles. Notwithstanding, such an application of machine learning suffers with several limitations when put into practice, such as unbalanced datasets and, specially, the absence of sufficient information from the features that can be useful to discriminate reliable and unreliable loans. To overcome such drawbacks, we propose in this work a Two-Step Feature Space Transforming approach, which operates by evolving feature information in a twofold operation: (i) data enhancement; and (ii) data discretization. In the first step, additional meta-features are used in order to improve data discrimination. In the second step, the goal is to reduce the diversity of features. Experiments results performed in real-world datasets with different levels of unbalancing show that such a step can improve, in a consistent way, the performance of the best machine learning algorithm for such a task.

In recent years, many novel machine learning models have been developed for credit scoring. Among the existing machine learning models, the heterogeneous ensemble model receives much attention because of its superior performance. This paper presents a new heterogeneous ensemble model based on the generalized Shapley value and the Choquet integral. To do this, the model first uses the fuzzy measure to express the interactive characteristics between any two coalitions of base learners. Based on the accuracy and diversity objective function, a linear programming model for determining the fuzzy measure is built. To retain the original information as much as possible in the training stage, the normal fuzzy number is employed to express the base learner predicted values. Then, the generalized Shapley Choquet integral (GSCI) aggregation operator is defined to calculate the comprehensive predicted value of the ensemble model. Based on the defined aggregation operator and linear programming model, a GSCI approach is proposed for ensemble credit scoring. To illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the GSCI approach, an experiment of thirteen machine learning models over four public credit scoring datasets and three real-world P2P leading datasets with large volumes of samples is made. Furthermore, robust tests and comparatives analysis are made to demonstrate the adaptability and performance of the GSCI-based ensemble model.",Credit scoring | heterogeneous ensemble | normal fuzzy number | the Choquet integral | the generalized Shapley function,8,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,CAE,2017TP1026,State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems

These techniques are used mainly for prediction, classification and partitioning data into different groups according to a certain common characteristic. In this work, we are interested in machine learning techniques for credit scoring and bankruptcy prediction in finance and banking. We evaluate and compare a range of machine learning techniques on several datasets issued from banks and financial institutions where the aim is to select the most appropriate methods suitable for each dataset. We use several metrics to evaluate the performance of the obtained models. The empirical studies are conducted on German, Australian, Japanese, Polish, Indian Qualitative Bankruptcy and Taiwan datasets. Also, we consider the huge 'Give Me Some Credit dataset'. The machine learning methods produce scores for applicants and companies and help a lot in the decision making. In other words, these methods permit us to distinguish between bad and good applicants or companies. The numerical study shows that there is no method able to consistently outperform the others on all the datasets. Also, there are significant differences between the studied methods on some datasets. For German and Give Me Some Credit datasets, the Bayes net method is able to produce good scores compared to the others studied methods. The LogitBoost method is competitive on both Polish and Australian datasets, while AdaBoost method is most appropriate for Japanese dataset. For Taiwan dataset, Random Forest method gives the best results compared to the other considered techniques. However, on Indian Qualitative Bankruptcy dataset, almost the methods are comparable due to the nature of this dataset.",Banking | bankruptcy prediction | classification | credit scoring | finance | machine learning,12,0,,,,undefined,

Lenders train these models on data from previously granted credit applications, where the borrowers’ repayment behavior has been observed. This approach creates sample bias. The scoring model is trained on accepted cases only. Applying the model to screen applications from the population of all borrowers degrades its performance. Reject inference comprises techniques to overcome sampling bias through assigning labels to rejected cases. This paper makes two contributions. First, we propose a self-learning framework for reject inference. The framework is geared toward real-world credit scoring requirements through considering distinct training regimes for labeling and model training. Second, we introduce a new measure to assess the effectiveness of reject inference strategies. Our measure leverages domain knowledge to avoid artificial labeling of rejected cases during evaluation. We demonstrate this approach to offer a robust and operational assessment of reject inference. Experiments on a real-world credit scoring data set confirm the superiority of the suggested self-learning framework over previous reject inference strategies. We also find strong evidence in favor of the proposed evaluation measure assessing reject inference strategies more reliably, raising the performance of the eventual scoring model.",Credit scoring | Evaluation | Reject inference | Self-learning,4,0,,,,undefined,

Borrowers can get financing more easily, but it means higher credit risk to lenders, making credit scoring models a key tool for lending P2P platforms. The goal is to estimate the level risk (being good or bad borrower), from the collected informations of each applicant. One of the classification approaches is Multi dimensional Hidden Markov Model (MDHMM). The MDHMM parameters are usually estimated using Baum-Welch algorithm (BW). However, the Baum-Welch algorithm tends to arrive at local optimal points. In this paper a strategy called Variable neighborhood search (VNS), is proposed to addresses this problem. The hybrid model in which VNS algorithm is coupled with Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter estimation of MDHMM, is applied in credit scoring domain, using real peer-to-peer lending data.

In this work, we assess the well-known logistic regression model and several machine learning algorithms for granting scoring in P2P lending. The comparison reveals that the machine learning alternative is superior in terms of not only classification performance but also explainability. More precisely, the SHAP values reveal that machine learning algorithms can reflect dispersion, nonlinearity and structural breaks in the relationships between each feature and the target variable.

Many standard statistical and machine learning techniques are used in the literature to build credit scoring models from training sets consisting of people in their records who were given loans in the past. Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a new financing channel which is based on electronic business platform and electronic commerce credit. In P2P lending, borrowers and lenders can use the internet platform to achieve online transactions. There is lower transaction cost, while the loan process is simple and easy to operate. Small and micro enterprises and individual borrowers that are difficult to get loans from the bank do not need loan guarantor and collateral in P2P, so they can get financing more easily. But it means higher credit risk to lenders. Many classification methods such as neural networks, support vector machines and random forests, have been suggested in the literature to improve credit scoring models in terms of their statistical performance. But there execution time can grow exponentially with the size of the instances, especially with the grow of Big Data sources like mobile phone data and social network data for credit scoring applications [18]. For these cases, metaheuristics like Hidden Markov Model (HMM) present a good alternative solution technique. A limitation of HMM is that it only supports one observed random variable. In case of the credit scoring, there are more variables that are relevant to the estimation. Multi dimensional Hidden Markov Model (MDHMM) extends hidden Markov model by supporting multiple observed variables. The iterative procedure of MDHMM greatly simplifies parallelized implementation and computations of innovative Big Data sources in credit scoring. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of MDHMM to addresses the credit scoring problem in Peer-To-Peer (P2P) lending. The performance of the proposed MDHMM method is validated on Lending Club (Peer-to-peer lending) credit dataset.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

In our experiments, we progressively increase the class imbalance in each of these datasets by randomly undersampling the minority class of defaulters to identify how the predictive power is affected.

The predictive capabilities of the models were compared to identify default-prediction mechanisms in the “My Home, My Life” Program (Programa “Minha Casa, Minha Vida” — PMCMV). The PMCMV is one of the largest government initiatives in the world to finance home ownership in the low-income population. Implemented by the Brazilian government, the programme has provided financing in excess of USD 84 billion and by 2016 had already contracted for the construction of over 4.5 million housing units, with 3.3 million units already delivered. The models developed in this study involve different time intervals for default prediction as well as analysis without the use of traditional discriminatory variables (gender, age, and marital status). Three measurements were used to evaluate the quality of the prediction models: area under the ROC curve, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov index, and the Brier score. The results indicated that (1) the accuracy of the models improves as the number of days overdue used to define the default variable increases; (2) the best prediction results were obtained with traditional ensemble techniques — in this case Bagging (BG), Random Forest (RF), and Boosting; and (3) there was a negative impact on all criteria when a smaller number of observations was used, especially on the type II error. It was also found that the discriminatory power of the credit risk rating system is preserved when removing discriminatory variables from the models. Applying the BG algorithm, which is the best prediction method, a default rate of 11.80% could be reduced to 2.95%, which leads to a selection that would result in 197,905 fewer delinquent contracts in the PMCMV, thus representing a savings of approximately USD 3.0 billion in credit losses.",Credit risk | Default prediction | Low-income housing program | Machine learning | Predictive performance measures,20,0,,,CNPq,310666/2016-3,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico

In this work, we propose a combination strategy of integrating unsupervised learning with supervised learning for credit risk assessment. The difference between our work and other previous work on unsupervised integration is that we apply unsupervised learning techniques at two different stages: the consensus stage and dataset clustering stage. Comparisons of model performance are performed based on three credit datasets in four groups: individual models, individual models + consensus model, clustering + individual models, clustering + individual models + consensus model. As a result, integration at either the consensus stage or dataset clustering stage is effective on improving the performance of credit scoring models. Moreover, the combination of the two stages achieves the best performance, thereby confirming the superiority of the proposed integration of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, which boost our confidence that this strategy can be extended to many other credit datasets from financial institutions.",Credit scoring | Ensemble model | Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) | Supervised machine learning | Unsupervised machine learning,64,0,,,UC,71271032,University of California

To investigate the efficiency and viability of the proposed hybrid models, we compared 16 hybrid models created by combining logistic regression (LR), discriminant analysis (DA), and decision trees (DT) with four types of neural network (NN): adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (ANFISs), deep neural networks (DNNs), radial basis function networks (RBFs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The experimental outcome, investigation, and statistical examination express the capacity of the planned hybrid model to develop a credit risk prediction technique different from all other approaches, as indicated by ten different performance measures. The classifier was authenticated on five real-world credit scoring data sets.",artificial intelligence (AI) | Credit risk prediction | hybrid model | traditional methods,23,0,,,NSFC,71431002,National Natural Science Foundation of China

This paper aims to propose the combined use of credit scoring and profit scoring to increase the effectiveness of the loan-granting process in credit unions. Design/methodology/approach: This sample is composed by the data of personal loans transactions of a Brazilian credit union. Findings: The analysis reveals that the use of statistical methods improves significantly the predictability of default when compared to the use of subjective techniques and the superiority of the random forests model in estimating credit scoring and profit scoring when compared to logit and ordinary least squares method (OLS) regression. The study also illustrates how both analyses can be used jointly for more effective decision-making. Originality/value: Replacing subjective analysis with objective credit analysis using deterministic models will benefit Brazilian credit unions. The credit decision will be based on the input variables and on clear criteria, turning the decision-making process impartial. The joint use of credit scoring and profit scoring allows granting credit for the clients with the highest potential to pay debt obligation and, at the same time, to certify that the transaction profitability meets the goals of the organization: to be sustainable and to provide loans and investment opportunities at attractive rates to members.",Credit unions,7,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Due to changes in the macroeconomic environment and markets, the relationship between client characteristics and credit assessment results may change over time, causing concept drift in client credit assessments. Moreover, client credit assessment data are naturally asymmetric and class imbalanced because of the screening of clients. Aiming at solving the joint research issue of concept drift and class imbalance in client credit assessments, in this paper, a novel sample-based online learning ensemble (SOLE) for client credit assessment is proposed. A novel multiple time scale ensemble classifier and a novel sample-based online class imbalance learning procedure are proposed to handle the potential concept drift and class imbalance in the client credit assessment data streams. The experiments are carried out on two real-world client credit assessment cases, which present a comprehensive comparison between the proposed SOLE and other state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. In addition, the base classifier preference and the computing resource consumption of all the comparative algorithms are tested. In general, SOLE achieves a better performance than other methods using fewer computing resources.

In the insurance industry an important question arises, namely: how can insurance renewal prices be adjusted? Such an adjustment has two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, insurers are forced to retain existing customers, while on the other hand insurers are also forced to increase revenue. Intuitively, one might assume that revenue increases by offering high renewal prices, however this might also cause many customers to terminate their contracts. Contrarily, low renewal prices help retain most existing customers, but could negatively affect revenue. Therefore, adjusting renewal prices is a non-trivial problem for the insurance industry. In this paper, we propose a novel modelization of the renewal price adjustment problem as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, as a Markov decision process (MDP). In particular, this study analyzes two different strategies to carry out this adjustment. The first is about maximizing revenue analyzing the effect of this maximization on customer retention, while the second is about maximizing revenue subject to the client retention level not falling below a given threshold. The former case is related to MDPs with a single criterion to be optimized. The latter case is related to Constrained MDPs (CMDPs) with two criteria, where the first one is related to optimization, while the second is subject to a constraint. This paper also contributes with the resolution of these models by means of a model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

This paper, through a review of the available literature seeks to analyse and evaluate machine-learning techniques that have been researched in the context of banking risk management, and to identify areas or problems in risk management that have been inadequately explored and are potential areas for further research. The review has shown that the application of machine learning in the management of banking risks such as credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk has been explored; however, it doesn’t appear commensurate with the current industry level of focus on both risk management and machine learning. A large number of areas remain in bank risk management that could significantly benefit from the study of how machine learning can be applied to address specific problems.",Bank | Credit scoring | Fraud | Machine learning | Risk management,136,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

However, most of them employ a static combiner to combine base classifiers, which do not consider the base classifiers’ characters and their dynamic classification ability. Though some dynamic ensemble methods are proposed, they need to produce a large number of base classifiers or employ a fixed combiner, which limit the generality of the ensemble methods. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic weighted ensemble method for credit scoring. Markov Chain is employed to model the change of each classifier’s classification ability and build a dynamic weighted trainable combiner, which dynamically assign weights to the base classifiers for each sample in the testing set. Through eight credit data sets from the real world, the experimental study demonstrates the ability and efficiency of the dynamic weighted ensemble method to improve prediction performance against the benchmark models, including some well-known individual classifiers and dynamic ensemble methods. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively decrease the misclassification cost, which can reduce risks for the financial institutions.",Credit scoring | Dynamic weighted ensemble | Machine learning | Markov chain,29,0,,,NSFC,71671019,National Natural Science Foundation of China

To enhance the understanding and transparency of a decision support system (or model) that can assist bank staffs on making their consumer credit loan decisions—while uncertainty exist—is of high business value. One of the promising approaches is multiple rule-based decision-making (MRDM), a subfield of the hybrid multiple criteria decision-making that leverages the advantages of machine learning, soft computing, and decision methods (or techniques). The MRDM approach reveals comprehensible logics (rules or patterns) that can be justified and compared with the existing knowledge of veterans to reinforce the confidence of their judgments.

However, in the financial domain expert-based credit risk models have still been dominating. Establishing meaningful benchmark and comparisons on machine-learning approaches and human expert-based models is a prerequisite in further introducing novel methods. Therefore, our main goal in this study is to establish a new benchmark using real consumer data and to provide machine-learning approaches that can serve as a baseline on this benchmark. We performed an extensive comparison between the machine-learning approaches and a human expert-based model-FICO credit scoring system-by using a Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data. As the SCF data is non-synthetic and consists of a large number of real variables, we applied two variable-selection methods: the first method used hypothesis tests, correlation and random forest-based feature importance measures and the second method was only a random forest-based new approach (NAP), to select the best representative features for effective modelling and to compare them. We then built regression models based on various machine-learning algorithms ranging from logistic regression and support vector machines to an ensemble of gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. Our results demonstrated that if lending institutions in the 2001s had used their own credit scoring model constructed by machine-learning methods explored in this study, their expected credit losses would have been lower, and they would be more sustainable. In addition, the deep neural networks and XGBoost algorithms trained on the subset selected by NAP achieve the highest area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy, respectively.",Automated credit scoring | Decision making | Internet bank | Machine learning | Sustainability,66,1,repositoryam,Green,CBNU,2017R1A2B4010826,Chungbuk National University

We investigate whether AI applications improve financial inclusion, as measured by three seemingly contradictory metrics, i.e. approval rate, default rate, and false rejection rate. We cooperate with an AI solution provider whose AI-based credit scoring models are widely used by online lenders in China. Using data obtained from these online lenders, we find that AI-based credit scoring models increase approval rate and reduce default rate simultaneously, which enhances both the magnitude and the quality of financial inclusion. AI-based credit scoring models also tend to reduce false rejection rate, suggesting that they can help provide access to capital to previously underserved population. We plan to collect more data and conduct additional analyses in the future to enrich our current findings and explore for underlying mechanisms.",Artificial intelligence | Credit scoring models | False rejection rate | Financial inclusion | Financial technologies,7,0,,,,undefined,

Building an ensemble learning model that has been proven to be typically more accurate and robust than individual classifiers, it is an important information management task of commercial banks and loan lenders. In this paper, a novel noise-adapted two-layer ensemble model for credit scoring based on backflow learning is proposed, in which five widely used base classifiers, i.e., extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, and linear discriminant analysis, are integrated. To amplify the strength and diversity of the base classifiers, a new backflow learning approach is proposed so that the base classifiers will relearn the misclassified data point. A final predictive result is obtained by fusing the prediction of all base classifiers through two-layer ensemble modeling. In addition, considering that noise data are a major problem that aggravates the accuracy of a predictive model, a new noise adaption approach based on the isolation forest algorithm is proposed to address noise data. It first calculates the outlier score of each data point to detect the noise data that are subsequently boosted in the training set to form the noise-adapted training set. Three credit datasets from the UCI machine learning repository are tested to compare the performance of the proposed model with those of other benchmark models. The experimental results prove that our proposed model outperforms other models by demonstrating satisfactory improvement in various performance measures.",Backflow learning | Credit scoring | Ensemble model | Feature engineering | Machine learning | Noise adaption,19,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,51475410,National Natural Science Foundation of China

CS is a score measure that helps lenders and creditors to see how good the borrower is. It indicates how likely the borrower is to pay back the owed debt, based on its past borrowing behavior. For instance, this score can be used to avoid risk and provide an objective analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness which reduces credit risk. Also CS allows the automation of the lending process which leads to increase the speed and consistency of the borrower’s application. In this paper, we propose to use agents’ technology to develop a cooperative classification system for credit scoring. Empirical studies are conducted on five well-known financial datasets. We distribute the complex classification problem on a set of intelligent and cooperative agents where each agent evaluates a given machine learning algorithm on the considered dataset.

Such an automation allows who work and offer services in the financial area to take quick decisions with regard to different services, first and foremost those concerning the consumer credit, whose requests have exponentially increased over the last years. In order to face some well-known problems related to the state-of-the-art credit scoring approaches, this paper formalizes a novel data model that we called Discretized Enriched Data (DED), which operates by transforming the original feature space in order to improve the performance of the credit scoring machine learning algorithms. The idea behind the proposed DED model revolves around two processes, the first one aimed to reduce the number of feature patterns through a data discretization process, and the second one aimed to enrich the discretized data by adding several meta-features. The data discretization faces the problem of heterogeneity, which characterizes such a domain, whereas the data enrichment works on the related loss of information by adding meta-features that improve the data characterization. Our model has been evaluated in the context of real-world datasets with different sizes and levels of data unbalance, which are considered a benchmark in credit scoring literature. The obtained results indicate that it is able to improve the performance of one of the most performing machine learning algorithm largely used in this field, opening up new perspectives for the definition of more effective credit scoring solutions.",Algorithms | Business Intelligence | Credit Scoring | Decision Support System | Machine Learning,9,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,MIUR,CUP F74G14000200008 F19G14000910008,Nvidia

Traditionally, financial experts assess borrowers' risk of default payments manually, but this process is tedious and time consuming, which are not widely applicable concerns for online P2P platforms. This paper proposes a hybrid of the simulated annealing and the extreme gradient boosting machine models in order to predict the likelihood of default payments based on users' finance histories. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model demonstrates its predictability with high recall scores. The proposed model not only out-performs over conventional algorithms including logistic regressions, support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks, but it also provides an efficient method for optimising hyper-parameters in the machine learning algorithms. Through the utilisation of the proposed data-driven models, the necessity of tedious and potentially inaccurate human labour can be significantly reduced, and service level agreements (SLAs) can be further improved by time reduction made possible through the introduction of advanced data mining approaches.",Big data | Credit risk | Credit scoring | Data mining | Extreme gradient boosting machines | Simulated annealing | XGBoost,2,0,,,,undefined,

This paper presents a novel multi-stage self-adaptive classifier ensemble model based on the statistical techniques and the machine learning techniques to improve the prediction performance. First, the multi-step data preprocessing is employed to process the original data into the standardized data and generate more representative features. Second, base classifiers can be self-adaptively selected from the candidate classifier repository according to their performance in datasets and their parameters are optimized by the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Third, the ensemble model is integrated through these optimized base classifiers, and it can generate new features through multi-layer stacking and obtain the classifier weights in the ensemble model through the particle swarm optimization. The proposed model is applied to credit scoring to test its prediction performance. In the experimental study, three real-world credit datasets and four evaluation indicators are adopted for the performance evaluation. The results show that compared to single classifier and other ensemble classification methods, the proposed model has better performance and better data adaptability.

Prediction of the loan defaulters in advance can help the financial institutions in undertaking some preventive measures to avoid granting loans to customers with potential risk and thereby reducing the amount of bad loans. Various machine learning techniques can play an important role in the identification of loan defaulters. The proposed work aims to identify and distinguish the good customers from bad customers by using different machine learning techniques. Two different tools Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) and KNIME (Konstanz Information Miner) are used for analyzing the performance of the classifiers.

In the first part of this study, we investigate the role of machine learning for applicant reassessment and propose a complementary screening step to an existing scoring system. We use a real data set from one of the prominent loan companies in Turkey. The information provided by the applicants form the variables in our analysis. The company’s experts have already labeled the clients as bad and good according to their ongoing payments. Using this labeled data set, we execute several methods to classify the bad applicants as well as the significant variables in this classification. As the data set consists of applicants who have passed the initial scoring system, most of the clients are marked as good.

The number of repaid loans is higher than that of defaulted ones. Therefore, the classification of these data is biased toward the majority class, which practically means that it tends to attribute a mistaken “good borrower” status even to “very risky borrowers”. In addition to the use of statistics and machine learning classifiers, this paper aims to explore the relevance and performance of sampling models combined with statistical prediction and artificial intelligence techniques to predict and quantify the default probability based on real-world credit data. Design/methodology/approach: A real database from a Tunisian commercial bank was used and unbalanced data issues were addressed by the random over-sampling (ROS) and synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). Performance was evaluated in terms of the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic curve. Findings: The results indicated that the combination of intelligent and statistical techniques and re-sampling approaches are promising for the default rate management and provide accurate credit risk estimates. Originality/value: This paper empirically investigates the effectiveness of ROS and SMOTE in combination with logistic regression, artificial neural networks and support vector machines. The authors address the role of sampling strategies in the Tunisian credit market and its impact on credit risk.

Default in payment is the failure of a customer to settle a bill within 90 days upon receipt. Frequently, credit scoring (CS) is employed to identify customers’ default probability. CS has been widely studied, and many computational methods have been proposed. The primary aim of this work is to develop a CS model to replace the pre-risk check of the e-commerce risk management system Risk Solution Services (RSS), which is currently one of the most used systems to estimate customers’ default probability. The pre-risk check uses data from the order process and includes exclusion rules and a generic CS model. The new model is supposed to replace the whole pre-risk check and has to work both in isolation and in integration with the RSS main risk check. An application of genetic programming (GP) to CS is presented in this paper. The model was developed on a real-world dataset provided by a well-known German financial solutions company. The dataset contains order requests processed by RSS. The results show that GP outperforms the generic CS model of the pre-risk check in both classification accuracy and profit. GP achieved competitive classificatory accuracy with several state-of-the-art machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, support vector machines and boosted trees.

Various statistics-based machine learning techniques have been employed for this task. “Curse of Dimensionality” is still a significant challenge in machine learning techniques. Some research has been carried out on Feature Selection (FS) using genetic algorithm as wrapper to improve the performance of credit scoring models. However, the challenge lies in finding an overall best method in credit scoring problems and improving the time-consuming process of feature selection. In this study, the credit scoring problem is investigated through feature selection to improve classification performance. This work proposes a novel approach to feature selection in credit scoring applications, called as Information Gain Directed Feature Selection algorithm (IGDFS), which performs the ranking of features based on information gain, propagates the top m features through the GA wrapper (GAW) algorithm using three classical machine learning algorithms of KNN, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for credit scoring. The first stage of information gain guided feature selection can help reduce the computing complexity of GA wrapper, and the information gain of features selected with the IGDFS can indicate their importance to decision making. Regarding the classification accuracy, SVM accuracy is always better than KNN and NB for Baseline techniques, GAW and IGDFS. Also, we can conclude that the IGDFS achieved better performance than generic GAW, and GAW obtained better performance than the corresponding single classifiers (baseline) for almost all cases, except for the German Credit dataset, IGDFS + KNN has worse performance than generic GAW and the single classifier KNN. Removing features with low information gain could produce conflict with the original data structure for KNN, and thus affect the performance of IGDFS + KNN. Regarding the ROC performance, for the German Credit Dataset, the three classic machine learning algorithms, SVM, KNN and Naïve Bayes in the wrapper of IGDFS GA obtained almost the same performance. For the Australian credit dataset and the Taiwan Credit dataset, the IGDFS + Naive Bayes achieved the largest area under ROC curves.",Accuracy | Credit scoring | Feature selection | Genetic algorithm in wrapper | Information gain | K nearest neighbour clustering | Naive Bayes classifier | ROC curve | Support vector machine,183,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In general, credit score is the primary indicator of creditworthiness of the person. This credit scoring technique is used by banks and other money lenders to build a probabilistic predictive model, called a scorecard for estimating the probability of defaulters. In the current global scenario, credit scoring is a major tool for risk evaluation and risk management for all the existing and emerging economies. With the introduction of Basel II Accord, Credit scoring has gained much significance in retail credit industry. In this paper, we performed an extensive comparative in order to classify the credit scoring and identification of best classifier. Furthermore, we used two different categories of classifiers i.e. individual and ensemble.

There are several credit scoring methods available in the literature, but one that is widely used is the FICO method. This method provides a score ranging from 300 to 850 as a fast filter for high-volume complex credit decisions. However, it falls short in the aspect of a decision support system where revised scoring can be achieved to reflect the borrower’s strength and weakness in each scoring dimension, as well as the possible trade-offs made to maintain one’s lending risk. Hence, this study discusses and develops a decision support tool for credit score model based on multi-criteria decision-making principles. In the proposed methodology, criteria weights are generated by fuzzy AHP. Fuzzy linguistic theory is applied in AHP to describe the uncertainties and vagueness arising from human subjectivity in decision making. Finally, drawing from the risk distance function, TOPSIS is used to rank the alternatives based on the least risk exposure. A sensitivity analysis is also demonstrated by the proposed fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS method.",Credit scoring | FICO | Fuzzy AHP | TOPSIS,42,0,,,,undefined,

Selective ensembles, an important part of this group of systems, are a promising field of research. However, none of them considers the relative costs of Type I error and Type II error for credit scoring when selecting classifiers, which bring higher risks for the financial institutions. Moreover, earlier dynamic selective ensembles usually select and combine classifiers for each test sample dynamically based on classifiers’ performance in the validation set, regardless of their behaviors in the testing set. To fill the gap and overcome the limitations, we propose a new dynamic ensemble classification method for credit scoring based on soft probability. In this method, the classifiers are first selected based on their classification ability and the relative costs of Type I error and Type II error in the validation set. With the selected classifiers, we combine different classifiers for the samples in the testing set based on their classification results to get an interval probability of default by using soft probability. The proposed method is compared with some well-known individual classifiers and ensemble classification methods, including five selective ensembles, for credit scoring by using ten real-world data sets and seven performance indicators. Through these analyses and statistical tests, the experimental results demonstrate the ability and efficiency of the proposed method to improve prediction performance against the benchmark models.",Credit scoring | Dynamic ensemble classification | Machine learning | Selective ensemble | Soft probability,88,0,,,NSFC,71171209,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Recent studies have shown that ensemble methods, which combine multiple algorithms that process different hypotheses to form a new hypothesis, generally outperform the other credit scoring approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous ensemble credit model that integrates the bagging algorithm with the stacking method. The proposed model differs from the extant ensemble credit models in three aspects, namely, pool generation, selection of base learners, and trainable fuser. Four popular evaluation metrics, including accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), AUC-H measure, and Brier score, are employed to measure the performance of alternative models. To confirm the efficiency of the proposed bstacking approach, a wide range of models, including individual classifiers, homogeneous ensemble model, and heterogeneous ensemble model, are introduced as benchmarks.

However, in practical applications, a large amount of irrelevant and redundant features in the credit data, which leads to higher computational complexity and lower prediction accuracy. So, the face of a large number of credit data, effective feature selection method is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel credit scoring model, called NCSM, based on feature selection and grid search to optimize random forest algorithm. The model reduces the influence of the irrelevant and redundant features and to get the higher prediction accuracy. In NCSM, the information entropy is regarded as the heuristic to select the optimal feature.

Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are the two main aspects considered in financial distress prediction. To assist in this determination, thereby lowering the risk borne by the financial institution, it is necessary to develop effective prediction models for prediction of the likelihood of bankruptcy and estimation of credit risk. A number of financial distress prediction models have been constructed, which utilize various machine learning techniques, such as single classifiers and classifier ensembles, but improving the prediction accuracy is the major research issue. In addition, aside from improving the prediction accuracy, there have been very few studies that specifically consider lowering the Type I error. In practice, Type I errors need to receive careful consideration during model construction because they can affect the cost to the financial institution. In this study, we introduce a classifier ensemble approach designed to reduce the misclassification cost. The outputs produced by multiple classifiers are combined by utilizing the unanimous voting (UV) method to find the final prediction result. Experimental results obtained based on four relevant datasets show that our UV ensemble approach outperforms the baseline single classifiers and classifier ensembles. Specifically, the UV ensemble not only provides relatively good prediction accuracy and minimizes Type I/II errors, but also produces the smallest misclassification cost.",Bankruptcy prediction | Classifier ensembles | Credit scoring | Financial distress prediction | Machine learning | Type I error,35,0,,,,undefined,

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a useful tool to assess the ability of a diagnostic test to discriminate among two classes or groups. In practice, multiple diagnostic tests or biomarkers may be combined to improve diagnostic accuracy, e.g. by maximizing the area under the ROC curve. In this paper we present Nonparametric Predictive Inference (NPI) for best linear combination of two biomarkers, where the dependence of the two biomarkers is modelled using parametric copulas. NPI is a frequentist statistical method that is explicitly aimed at using few modelling assumptions, enabled through the use of lower and upper probabilities to quantify uncertainty. The combination of NPI for the individual biomarkers, combined with a basic parametric copula to take dependence into account, has good robustness properties and leads to quite straightforward computation. We briefly comment on the results of a simulation study to investigate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the empirical method.

At the same time business credit scoring still relies on financial data and is based on traditional methods. Such approaches, however, have the following limitations. First, financial reports are compiled typically once a year, hence scoring is infrequent. Second, since there is a delay of up to two years in publishing financial reports, scoring is based on outdated data and is not applied to young businesses. Third, quality of manually crafted models, although human-interpretable, is typically inferior to the ones constructed via machine learning. In this paper we describe an approach for applying extreme gradient boosting with Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization and ensemble learning for business credit scoring with frequently changing/updated data such as debts and network metrics from board membership/ownership networks.

Computational experiments show statistical significance of the classification quality improvement for all considered datasets. The method is compared with four other widely used methods of outlier detection: deviance, Pearson and Bayesian residuals and gamma plots.

Furthermore, we propose a new framework to evaluate the performance of credit ratings from multiple perspectives. The framework contains two components, defaulter recognition and rating quality. We use generic indices, area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and log loss, to evaluate the defaulter recognition ability of credit rating models. However, rating quality is more complicated than defaulter recognition. Inspired by rating agencies, we propose indices that reflect stability and migration of rating. We also adopt minimum default distance and rating path for evaluation of rating quality. Experimental results indicate that random forest (RF) has the best performance among the generic indices, but its stability is demonstrated to be 63% lower than the other two models. Similar results were found in the ratings path to default and minimum default distance.

In the past, numerous works have focused on studying the effect on meta-cognition for learning patterns from data in a supervised fashion. In this paper, we attempt to study the effect of meta-cognition towards efficient feature representation in a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). To this end, we develop a Meta-cognitive Restricted Boltzmann Machine (McRBM) that decides what-to-represent, how-to-represent and when-to-represent for each sample in the training data set through its Sample deletion, Feature Representation and Sample Reserve strategies, respectively. The meta-cognitive component of McRBM helps to improve the generative training of RBM. The features thus generated by RBM are then used in classification through back propagation learning, which is derived based on the hinge-loss error function. The McRBM is used to solve credit scoring problem using the German credit data set, Australian credit data set and the KAGGLE credit data set. Performance of McRBM is compared against the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Multi-layer Perceptron with Back Propagation (MLP-BP), and Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ClassRBM).

The most important ones are the data unbalance between the default and the non-default cases that reduces the effectiveness of almost all techniques, and the data heterogeneity, which makes it difficult the definition of a model able to effectively evaluate all the new loan applications. The approach proposed in this paper faces the aforementioned problems by moving the evaluation process from the canonical time domain to a frequency one, using a model based on the past non-default loan applications. It allows us to overcome the data unbalance problem by exploiting only a class of data, also defining a model that is less influenced by the data heterogeneity.

In this paper, we present a novel architecture-a Decision Stream,-aimed to overcome this problem. Instead of building a tree structure during the learning process, we propose merging nodes from different branches based on their similarity that is estimated with two-sample test statistics, which leads to generation of a deep directed acyclic graph of decision rules that can consist of hundreds of levels. To evaluate the proposed solution, we test it on several common machine learning problems-credit scoring, twitter sentiment analysis, aircraft flight control, MNIST and CIFAR image classification, synthetic data classification and regression. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the standard decision tree learning methods on both regression and classification tasks, yielding a prediction error decrease up to 35%.",Data fusion | decision tree | Distributed machine learning | Two-sample test statistic,13,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this paper, it is extended a previous work about the selection of the best base classifier used in ensembles on credit data sets. It is shown that a very simple base classifier, based on imprecise probabilities and uncertainty measures, attains a better trade-off among some aspects of interest for this type of studies such as accuracy and area under ROC curve (AUC). The AUC measure can be considered as a more appropriate measure in this grounds, where the different type of errors have different costs or consequences.

Unfortunately, such tools have an inability to provide an explanation, or comprehensible justification, for the solutions they supply. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to model credit scoring data, which exploits, indirectly, the classification power of the kernel machines into an operative field. A reconstruction process of the kernel classifier is performed via linear regression, if all predictors are numerical, or via a general linear model, if some or all predictors are categorical. The loss of performance, due to such approximation, is balanced by better interpretability for the end user, which is able to order, understand and to rank the influence of each category of the variables set in the prediction.

Despite the huge number of inhabitants, these markets still lack a proper finance infrastructure. One of the main difficulties felt by customers is the access to loans. This limitation arises from the fact that most customers usually lack a verifiable credit history. As such, traditional banks are unable to provide loans. This paper proposes credit scoring modeling based on non-traditional data, acquired from smartphones, for loan classification processes. We use Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models which are the top performers in traditional banking. Then we compared the transformation of the training datasets creating boolean indicators against recoding using Weight of Evidence (WoE). Our models surpassed the performance of the manual loan application selection process, loans granted through the models criteria presented fewer overdues, also the approval criteria of the models increased the amount of granted loans substantially. Compared to the baseline, the loans approved by meeting the criteria of the SVM model presented −196.80% overdue rate. At the same time, the approval criteria of the SVM model generated 251.53% more loans. This paper shows that credit scoring can be useful in emerging markets.

The importance of credit scoring has increased recently because of the financial crisis and increased capital requirements for banks. There are, however, only few studies that develop credit coring models for SME lending. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel, more accurate credit risk estimation approach for SMEs business lending. Based on traditional statistical methods and recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we proposed a hybrid model which combines the logistic regression approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). In order to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed hybrid model, we use the data of Finnish SMEs from the fiscal years 2004 to 2012. Our results suggest that the proposed ANN/logistic hybrid model is more accurate than either of the initial models ANN or logistic regression. This improvement in the accuracy of the credit scoring model decreases evaluation errors and has thereby many potential practical implications. First of all, a more accurate credit scoring model can result in better performance of the whole SME loan portfolio. Second, it can also result in lower capital requirements from the banks perspective and lower interest rates from the individual firm's perspective.

Regarding this, researchers have developed complex credit scoring models using statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help banks and financial institutions to support their financial decisions. Various models, from easy to advanced approaches, have been developed in this domain. However, during the last few years there has been marked attention towards development of ensemble or multiple classifier systems, which have proved their ability to be more accurate than single classifier models. However, among the multiple classifier systems models developed in the literature, there has been little consideration given to: 1) combining classifiers of different algorithms (as most have focused on building classifiers of the same algorithm); or 2) exploring different classifier output combination techniques other than the traditional ones, such as majority voting and weighted average. In this paper, the aim is to present a new combination approach based on classifier consensus to combine multiple classifier systems (MCS) of different classification algorithms. Specifically, six of the main well-known base classifiers in this domain are used, namely, logistic regression (LR), neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT) and naïve Bayes (NB). Two benchmark classifiers are considered as a reference point for comparison with the proposed method and the other classifiers. These are used in combination with LR, which is still considered the industry-standard model for credit scoring models, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), a widely adopted technique in credit scoring studies. The experimental results, analysis and statistical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed combination method to improve prediction performance against all base classifiers, namely, LR, MARS and seven traditional combination methods, in terms of average accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), the H-measure and Brier score (BS).

These unrealistic assumptions definitely undermine the performance of the resulting corporate credit rating systems used to inform expert decisions. To address these shortcomings, in this work we propose a novel corporate credit rating system based on Student's-t hidden Markov models (SHMMs), which are a well-established method for modeling heavy-tailed time-series data: Under our approach, we use a properly selected set of financial ratios to perform credit scoring, which we model via SHMMs. We evaluate our method using a dataset pertaining to Greek corporations and SMEs; this dataset includes five-year financial data, and delinquency behavioral information. We perform extensive comparisons of the credit risk assessments obtained from our method with other models commonly used by financial institutions.

Findings: In this research, an algorithm to select best features was developed by using the best average and median scores and the lowest standard deviation as the rules of feature scoring. Consequently, the dimension of features can be reduced to the smallest possible number that allows of a remarkable runtime reduction.

The results further reveal that the prediction performance of the models declines around the threshold rating that is located between investment grade and speculative grade which is not necessarily the result of inadequacy of the models.

Our method generates, in a single experiment, an optimized collection of solutions (financial FRBCs) characterized by various levels of accuracy-interpretability trade-off. In our approach we address the complexity- and semantics-related interpretability issues, we introduce original genetic operators for the classifier's rule base processing, and we implement our ideas in the context of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), i.e., one of the presently most advanced MOEOAs.

Our approach significantly outperforms the alternative methods in terms of the interpretability of the obtained financial data classifiers while remaining either competitive or superior in terms of their accuracy and the speed of decision making.",Accuracy and interpretability of credit classification systems | Financial decision support | Fuzzy rule-based systems | Genetic computations | Multi-objective evolutionary optimization,85,0,,,,undefined,

Several models are considered, starting with the logistic regression which is a standard approach in credit risk modelling. Some important improvements are investigated. Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) regression is applied in contrast to the logistic regression in order to produce more conservative estimates of default probability. The assumption of non-linearity is relaxed through application of BGEVA, non-parametric additive model based on the GEV link function. Two methods of handling missing values are compared: multiple imputation and Weights of Evidence (WoE) transformation. The results suggest that the best predictive performance is obtained by BGEVA, thus implying the necessity of taking into account the low volume of defaults and non-linear patterns when modelling SME performance. WoE for the majority of models considered show better prediction as compared to multiple imputation, suggesting that missing values could be informative.",Credit scoring | Decision support systems | Default prediction | Risk analysis | Small and Medium Sized Enterprises,29,0,repositoryam,Green,ESRC,ES/L011859/1,Economic and Social Research Council

The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves.

From this viewpoint, loan applications evaluation is a classification task, in which the final decision can be either a crisp yes/no decision about the loan or a numeric score expressing the financial standing of the applicant. The knowledge to be used is inferred from data about past decisions. These data usually consist of both socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the applicant (e.g., age, income, and deposit), the characteristics of the loan, and the loan approval decision. A number of machine learning algorithms can be used for this purpose. In this paper we show how this task can be performed using the LISp-Miner system, a tool that is under development at the University of Economics, Prague. LISp-Miner is primarily focused on mining for various types of association rules, but unlike ""classical"" association rules proposed by Agrawal, LISp-Miner introduces a greater variety of different types of relations between the left-hand and right-hand sides of a rule. Two other procedures that can be used for classification task are implemented in LISp-Miner as well.

Their objective is to divide the loan applicants into two classes, reliable or unreliable, on the basis of the available information. The linear discriminant analysis is one of the most common techniques used to define these models, although this simple parametric statistical method does not overcome some problems, the most important of which is the imbalanced distribution of data by classes. It happens since the number of default cases is much smaller than that of non-default ones, a scenario that reduces the effectiveness of the machine learning approaches, e.g., neural networks and random forests. The in Maximum Entropy (DME) approach proposed in this paper leads toward two interesting results: on the one hand, it evaluates the new loan applications in terms of maximum entropy difference between their features and those of the non-default past cases, using for the model training only these last cases, overcoming the imbalanced learning issue; on the other hand, it operates proactively, overcoming the cold-start problem.

The use of data mining techniques to build models for credit scoring has been a hot topic in recent years. Classification problems often have a large number of features, but not all of them are useful for classification. Irrelevant and redundant features in credit data may even reduce the classification accuracy. Feature selection is a process of selecting a subset of relevant features, which can decrease the dimensionality, reduce the running time, and improve the accuracy of classifiers. Random forest (RF) is a powerful classification tool which is currently an active research area and successfully solves classification problems in many domains. In this study, we constructed a fast credit scoring model based on parallel Random forests and Recursive Feature Elimination (FRFE). Two public UCI data sets, Australia and German credit have been used to test our method.

Many classification systems like image retrieval and credit scoring systems have imbalanced distribution of training data sets which causes performance degradation of the classifier. Re-sampling of imbalanced data is commonly used to handle imbalanced distribution as it is independent of the classifier being used. But sometimes they can remove necessary data of the class or can cause over-fitting. Classifier Ensembles have recently achieved more attention as effective technique to handle skewed data. The focus of the work is to gain advantages of both data level and classifier ensemble approach in order to improve the classification performance. We present a novel approach that initially applies pre-processing to the imbalanced dataset in order to reduce the imbalance between the classes. The pre-processed data is provided as training dataset to the classifier ensemble that introduces diversity by using different training datasets as well as different classifier models. The experimentation conducted on the eight imbalanced datasets from KEEL repository helps to prove the significance of the proposed method.

Their credit scoring systems, if they exist, are strictly financial. Although many institutions consider the social and environmental impact of their loans, they do not incorporate formal systems to estimate these social and environmental impacts. This paper proposes that their creditworthiness evaluations should be coherent with their social mission and, accordingly, should estimate the social and environmental impact of microcredit. Thus, a decision support system to facilitate microcredit granting is proposed using a multicriteria evaluation. The assessment of social impact is performed by calculating the Social Net Present Value. The system captures credit officers' experience and addresses incomplete and intangible information. The model has been tested in a microfinance institution. The paper shows how a small institution can include social and environmental issues in its decision-making systems to evaluate credit applications. A gap in the preferences was found between members of the board, who are socially driven, and managers and credit officers, who are financially drifted. This mission drift was corrected.

Most of these methods classify individuals into two categories: 'good' or 'bad' creditworthiness.

In practice, banks mostly grant loans applying decision support system that makes no price differentiation for individuals according to their private information. A bank may differentiate a loan price to attract a specific group of borrowers. In this paper, loan price differentiation impact on the behaviour of banks potential borrowers in the market for consumer lending is analyzed. A concept of a decision support system for loan granting based on the use of a continuous loan price function of the borrower's creditworthiness rating is proposed. Competition between banks using different loan price function of creditworthiness rating is analyzed. Borrowers with a low credit risk are interested in switching to a bank that reflects more private information in a loan price. Application of the proposed system provides a competitive advantage for a bank to attract borrowers with a low credit risk.

To this end we propose as a first stage to use a microaggregation procedure in order to anonymize data over personal credit client feature information. In a second stage we examine the performance of support vector machines (SVM) on such anonymized data. SVM are powerful and robust machine learning methods, having superior credit scoring classification performance when applied to original, non-anonymized data. We first partition the original credit scoring data set and construct anonymized data representatives, which are then used for credit client behavior forecasting models constructed by SVM and other comparable learning methods. The validation procedure for such models is adapted to the two-stage modeling approach.

Class 2 definitions redefine marginal probabilities from the joint probabilities. In fact, the marginal probabilities are given from the ensembles and should not be redefined from the joint probabilities. Both Class 1 and Class 2 definitions assume a joint distribution exists.

However, most works only focused on applying specific feature selection methods over either bankruptcy prediction or credit scoring problem domains. In this work, a comprehensive study is conducted to examine the effect of performing filter and wrapper based feature selection methods on financial distress prediction.

Our experimental results show that there is no the best combination of the feature selection method and the classification technique over the four datasets.

In our analysis, we aim to explore different methods for optimizing the scoring problem in order to maximize the AUC. Not only are the existing methods pertaining to the use of the AUC to measure prediction accuracy evaluated, but the AUC is introduced as an objective function to optimize prediction accuracy directly. For the AUC approach, the coefficients are estimated by calculating the AUC measure using theWilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Nelder-Mead algorithms. In a simulation study, we compare our new method to the logit model using different measures for predictive performance. The simulation study indicates the superiority of the AUC approach in cases where the logistic model assumption fails. From machine learning we explore boosting methods by additionally using the AUC as a loss function. Our evaluation of German retail credit data includes different performance measures and shows superior results in terms of the prediction accuracy of the boosting algorithms as well as the AUC approach compared with the most widely used logistic regression model.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

We then calibrate logistic regressions with variable selection on the samples created by each method, plus one using all the data in the training set (biased base method), and validate the models on an independent data set. We find that the regression built using all the observations shows the highest area under the ROC curve and Kolmogorv–Smirnov statistics, while the regression that uses the least amount of observations shows the lowest performance and highest variance of these indicators. Nevertheless, the fourth selection algorithm presented shows almost the same performance as the base method using just 14 % of the dataset, and 14 less variables. We conclude that violating the independence assumption does not impact strongly on results and, furthermore, trying to control it by using less data can harm the performance of calibrated models, although a better sampling method does lead to equivalent results with a far smaller dataset needed.",,2,0,,,,undefined,Universidad de Chile

In the prior literature, various classification techniques have been developed and studied, in/with which classifier ensembles by combining multiple classifiers approach have shown their outperformance over many single classifiers. However, in terms of constructing classifier ensembles, there are three critical issues which can affect their performance. The first one is the classification technique actually used/adopted, and the other two are the combination method to combine multiple classifiers and the number of classifiers to be combined, respectively. Since there are limited, relevant studies examining these aforementioned disuses, this paper conducts a comprehensive study of comparing classifier ensembles by three widely used classification techniques including multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees (DT) based on two well-known combination methods including bagging and boosting and different numbers of combined classifiers. Our experimental results by three public datasets show that DT ensembles composed of 80-100 classifiers using the boosting method perform best. The Wilcoxon signed ranked test also demonstrates that DT ensembles by boosting perform significantly different from the other classifier ensembles.

However, in the real world, a substantial portion of the exposures is included in low-default portfolios (LDPs) in which the number of defaulted loans is usually much lower than the number of non-default observations. Modelling of these imbalanced data sets is particularly problematic with small portfolios in which the absence of information increases the specification error. Sovereigns, banks, or specialised retail exposures are recent examples of post-crisis portfolios with insufficient data for PD estimates, which require specific tools for risk quantification and validation. This paper explores the suitability of cooperative strategies for managing such scarce LDPs. In addition to the use of statistical and machine-learning classifiers, this paper explores the suitability of cooperative models and bootstrapping strategies for default prediction and multi-grade PD setting using two real-world credit consumer data sets. The performance is assessed in terms of out-of-sample and out-of-time discriminatory power, PD calibration, and stability. The results indicate that combinational approaches based on correlation-adjusted strategies are promising techniques for managing sparse LDPs and providing accurate and well-calibrated credit risk estimates. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Improving the accuracy of classification by even a fraction of one percent translates into significant future savings for the credit companies and increased efficiency when supporting more efficient use of economic capital by enterprise administrators. To increase the accuracy of classification and develop an efficient classifier, this work presents a hybrid artificial immune algorithm and multilayer perceptron (AIA-MLP) classifier. The optimization of weights in the network topology of the MLP classifier can be considered as an unconstrained global optimization problem in which an energy function is minimized. Therefore, weights in the network topology of the MLP classifier can be optimized efficiently using the AIA approach, which is a stochastic global optimization method. The performance of the proposed AIA-MLP classifier is evaluated by using a real-world dataset of Australian credit approvals, which was taken from the UCI repository of machine learning databases. This work compares experimental results concerning the AIA-MLP classifier with those concerning many support vector machine (SVM) and an MIMO cerebellar model articulation controller neural network (CMAC NN) classifiers. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of classification of the AIA-MLP classifier is superior to those of many SVM and the MIMO CMAC NN classifiers. © 2014 ISSN 1881-803X.",Artificial immune algorithm | Classification | Credit risk evaluation | Credit scoring | Multilayer perceptron,0,0,,,,undefined,

Incorrect decision-making in financial institutions is very likely to cause financial crises and distress. Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are two important problems facing financial decision support. As many related studies develop financial distress models by some machine learning techniques, more advanced machine learning techniques, such as classifier ensembles and hybrid classifiers, have not been fully assessed. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel hybrid financial distress model based on combining the clustering technique and classifier ensembles. In addition, single baseline classifiers, hybrid classifiers, and classifier ensembles are developed for comparisons. In particular, two clustering techniques, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and k-means and three classification techniques, logistic regression, multilayer-perceptron (MLP) neural network, and decision trees, are used to develop these four different types of bankruptcy prediction models. As a result, 21 different models are compared in terms of average prediction accuracy and Type I & II errors. By using five related datasets, combining Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) with MLP classifier ensembles performs the best, which provides higher predication accuracy and lower Type I & II errors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a neurocomputing-based granular approach is proposed to model credit scoring. Granular computing is used to compute the size of training and testing groups. Artificial neural networks (ANN) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) are used to model credit lending decisions in the online and offline manner, respectively.

Also credibility is modeled via DEA in offline module in present study.

TOPSIS is famous for reliable evaluation results and quick computing process and it is easy to understand and use. However, it is a ranking approach and three challenges have to be faced for modifying TOPSIS into a classification approach. C-TOPSIS works out three strategies to overcome the challenges and retains the advantages of TOPSIS.

Evaluations on three credit datasets show that feature subsets selected by fusion methods are either superior to or at least as adequate as those selected by individual methods. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,12,0,,,,undefined,

However, credit scoring in the microfinance industry is a relatively recent application, and current research is based, to the best of our knowledge, on classical statistical methods. This lack is surprising since the implementation of credit scoring based on supervised classification algorithms should contribute towards the efficiency of microfinance institutions, thereby improving their competitiveness in an increasingly constrained environment. This paper explores an extensive list of Statistical Learning techniques as microfinance credit scoring tools from an empirical viewpoint. A data set of microcredits belonging to a Peruvian Microfinance Institution is considered, and the following models are applied to decide between default and non-default credits: linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machines, classification trees, and ensemble methods based on bagging and boosting algorithm. The obtained results suggest the use of a multilayer perceptron trained in the R statistical system with a second order algorithm. Moreover, our findings show that, with the implementation of this MLP-based model, the MFIś misclassification costs could be reduced to 13.7% with respect to the application of other classic models. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Default probabilities provide more detailed information about the creditworthiness of consumers, and they are usually estimated by logistic regression. Here, we present a general framework for estimating individual consumer credit risks by use of machine learning methods. Since a probability is an expected value, all nonparametric regression approaches which are consistent for the mean are consistent for the probability estimation problem. Among others, random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and bagged k-nearest neighbors (bNN) belong to this class of consistent nonparametric regression approaches. We apply the machine learning methods and an optimized logistic regression to a large dataset of complete payment histories of short-termed installment credits. We demonstrate probability estimation in Random Jungle, an RF package written in C++ with a generalized framework for fast tree growing, probability estimation, and classification. We also describe an algorithm for tuning the terminal node size for probability estimation.

Recently, different contributions from both fields have been made on the models design for problems with multi-criteria. The credit scoring problem is an example of that. In this problem, one evaluates how unlikely a client will default with his payments. Client profiles are evaluated, being their results expressed in terms of an ordinal score scale (Excelent Good Fair Poor). Intelligent systems have then to take in consideration different criteria such as payment history, mortgages, wages among others in order to commit their outcome. To achieve this goal, researchers have been delving models capable to render these multiple criteria encompassed on ordinal data. The literature presents a myriad of different methods either on OR or AI fields for the multi-criteria models. However, a description of ordinal data methods on these two major disciplines and their relations has not been thoroughly conducted yet. It is key for further research to identify the developments made and the present state of the existing methods.

Although there are many studies regarding decision-making problems, such as credit policy decisions through bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring, there is no research, to our knowledge, about dividend prediction or dividend policy forecasting using machine learning approaches in spite of the significance of dividends. For dealing with the problems involved in literature, we suggest a knowledge refinement model that can refine the multiple rules extracted through rule-based algorithms from dividend data sets by utilizing genetic algorithm (GA). The new technique, called ""GAKR (genetic algorithm knowledge refinement)"", aims to combine the advantages of both knowledge consolidation and GA. The main result of the cross-validation procedure is the average accuracy rate of prediction in the five sets over the five iterations. The experiments show that GAKR model always outperforms other models in the performance of dividend policy prediction; we can predict future dividend policy more correctly than any other models. The major advantages of GAKR model can be summarized as follows: (1) Classification process of GAKR can be very fast with a compact set of rules. In other words, fast training mechanism of GAKR is possible regardless of data set sizes. (2) Multiple rules extracted by GAKR development process are much simpler and easier to understand. Moreover, GAKR model can discriminate redundant rules and inconsistent rules. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information.

Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are the two major research problems in the accounting and finance domain. In the literature, a number of models have been developed to predict whether borrowers are in danger of bankruptcy and whether they should be considered a good or bad credit risk. Since the 1990s, machine-learning techniques, such as neural networks and decision trees, have been studied extensively as tools for bankruptcy prediction and credit score modeling. This paper reviews 130 related journal papers from the period between 1995 and 2010, focusing on the development of state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques, including hybrid and ensemble classifiers. Related studies are compared in terms of classifier design, datasets, baselines, and other experimental factors.

Specifically, the academic research efforts which are reviewed are those that consist of hybrid systems. These systems combine two or more intelligent techniques in several forms to derive the advantages of all of them. There are four ways to elaborate a hybrid system: first, by constructing a hybrid algorithm which tightly combines two or more single algorithms. Second, by using an ensemble, which is the combination of the results of a pool of models. Third, by using an algorithm to select the relevant variables and another one to perform the scoring. And finally, by clustering individuals and using this information for the scoring stage.

However, the performance of DT based credit scoring model is often relatively poorer than other techniques. This is mainly due to two reasons: DT is easily affected by (1) the noise data and (2) the redundant attributes of data under the circumstance of credit scoring. In this study, we propose two dual strategy ensemble trees: RS-Bagging DT and Bagging-RS DT, which are based on two ensemble strategies: bagging and random subspace, to reduce the influences of the noise data and the redundant attributes of data and to get the relatively higher classification accuracy. Two real world credit datasets are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed methods. Experimental results reveal that single DT gets the lowest average accuracy among five single classifiers, i.e., Logistic Regression Analysis (LRA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN). Moreover, RS-Bagging DT and Bagging-RS DT get the better results than five single classifiers and four popular ensemble classifiers, i.e., Bagging DT, Random Subspace DT, Random Forest and Rotation Forest. The results show that RS-Bagging DT and Bagging-RS DT can be used as alternative techniques for credit scoring. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The hybrid model simultaneously optimizes the SVM kernel function parameters and the input feature subset in order to achieve a high accuracy.

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be socially and legally fair from a viewpoint of social responsibility; namely, it must be unbiased and nondiscriminatory in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. From a privacy-preserving viewpoint, this can be interpreted as hiding sensitive information when classification results are observed. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency. © 2011 IEEE.",Classification | Discrimination | Fairness | Information theory | Logistic regression | Privacy,219,0,repositoryvor,Green,JSPS,22500142,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

However, these kinds of strategies have serious limits and don't take into account the characteristics difference between current customers and the future ones. The aim of this paper is to measure credit worthiness for non customers borrowers and to model potential risk given a heterogeneous population formed by borrowers customers of the bank and others who are not. We hold on previous works done in generalized discrimination and transpose them into the logistic model to bring out efficient discrimination rules for non customers' subpopulation. Therefore we obtain seven simple models of connection between parameters of both logistic models associated respectively to the two subpopulations.

We show that minimal neural networks with as few as one hidden unit provide good predictive accuracy, while having the added advantage of making it easier to generate concise and comprehensible classification rules for the user. To further reduce model size, a novel approach is suggested in which network connections from the input units to this hidden unit are removed by a very straightaway pruning procedure. In terms of predictive accuracy, both the minimized neural networks and the rule sets generated from them are shown to compare favorably with other neural network based classifiers.

The question is answered by comparing the performance of a variety of one-class and two-class classifiers on a selection of credit scoring datasets as the class imbalance is manipulated. We also include random oversampling as this is one of the most common approaches to addressing class imbalance. This study analyses the suitability and performance of recognised two-class classifiers and one-class classifiers. Based on our study we conclude that the performance of the two-class classifiers deteriorates proportionally to the level of class imbalance. The two-class classifiers outperform one-class classifiers with class imbalance levels down as far as 15% (i.e. the imbalance ratio of minority class to majority class is 15:85). The one-class classifiers, whose performance remains unvaried throughout, are preferred when the minority class constitutes approximately 2% or less of the data. Between an imbalance of 2% to 15% the results are not as conclusive.

Discrimination in credit, mortgage, insurance, labor market, and education has been investigated by researchers in economics and human sciences. With the advent of automatic decision support systems, such as credit scoring systems, the ease of data collection opens several challenges to data analysts for the fight against discrimination. In this article, we introduce the problem of discovering discrimination through data mining in a dataset of historical decision records, taken by humans or by automatic systems. We formalize the processes of direct and indirect discrimination discovery by modelling protected-by-law groups and contexts where discrimination occurs in a classification rule based syntax. Basically, classification rules extracted from the dataset allow for unveiling contexts of unlawful discrimination, where the degree of burden over protected-by-law groups is formalized by an extension of the lift measure of a classification rule. In direct discrimination, the extracted rules can be directly mined in search of discriminatory contexts. In indirect discrimination, the mining process needs some background knowledge as a further input, for example, census data, that combined with the extracted rules might allow for unveiling contexts of discriminatory decisions. A strategy adopted for combining extracted classification rules with background knowledge is called an inference model. In this article, we propose two inference models and provide automatic procedures for their implementation.

Recently, a more pragmatic approach has been adopted, where the first issue is credit risk prediction, instead of explanation. In this context, several classification techniques have been shown to perform well on credit scoring, such as support vector machines among others. While the investigation of better classifiers is an important research topic, the specific methodology chosen in real world applications has to deal with the challenges arising from the real world data collected in the industry. Such data are often highly unbalanced, part of the information can be missing and some common hypotheses, such as the i.i.d. one, can be violated. In this paper we present a case study based on a sample of IBM Italian customers, which presents all the challenges mentioned above. The main objective is to build and validate robust models, able to handle missing information, class unbalancedness and non-iid data points. We define a missing data imputation method and propose the use of an ensemble classification technique, subagging, particularly suitable for highly unbalanced data, such as credit scoring data. Both the imputation and subagging steps are embedded in a customized cross-validation loop, which handles dependencies between different credit requests. The methodology has been applied using several classifiers (kernel support vector machines, nearest neighbors, decision trees, Adaboost) and their subagged versions. The use of subagging improves the performance of the base classifier and we will show that subagging decision trees achieve better performance, still keeping the model simple and reasonably interpretable. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A novel credit-scoring model, called vertical bagging decision trees model (abbreviated to VBDTM), is proposed for the purpose in this paper. The model is a new bagging method that is different from the traditional bagging. The VBDTM model gets an aggregation of classifiers by means of the combination of predictive attributes. In the VBDTM model, all train samples and just parts of attributes take part in learning of every classifier. By contrast, classifiers are trained with the sample subsets in the traditional bagging method and every classifier has the same attributes. The VBDTM has been tested by two credit databases from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the analysis results show that the performance of the method proposed by us is outstanding on the prediction accuracy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the key outputs of an internal rating system is the probability of default (PD), which reflects the likelihood that a counterparty will default on his/her financial obligation. Since the PD modelling problem basically boils down to a discrimination problem (defaulter or not), one may rely on the myriad of classification techniques that have been suggested in the literature. However, since the credit risk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation, they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines are less suitable due to their black box nature. Building upon previous research, we will use AntMiner to build internal rating systems for credit risk. AntMiner allows to infer a propositional rule set from a given data set, hereby using the principles from Ant Colony Optimization. Experiments will be conducted using various types of credit data sets (retail, small- and medium-sized enterprises and banks). It will be shown that the extracted rule sets are both powerful in terms of discriminatory power and comprehensibility.

The proposed decision support system is expected to be used by the banks when they want to determine whether an applicant firm is worth a detailed credit check or not. Using such a quick credit scoring decision model reduces the banks' workload. The proposed credit scoring model is based on the financial ratios and fuzzy TOPSIS approach. It obtains two separate scores which reflect the attractiveness of manufacturing industries within the overall economy and manufacturing firms' performance with respect to its competitors belonging to the same industry. These two scores are then used to determine the credibility of applicant manufacturing firms. The developed decision support system is tested with various real cases and satisfactory results are obtained.

However credit scoring methods are prone to error. Failures from credit scoring result in granting loans to high risk customers, thus significantly increasing the incidence of overdue payments, or in the worst case, customers defaulting on the loan altogether. In this research the authors use a machine learning approach to improve the identification of such customers. However, identifying such bad customers is not a trivial task as they form the minority of customers and standard machine learning algorithms have difficulty in learning accurate models on such imbalanced datasets. They propose a novel approach based on a data segmentation strategy that progressively partitions the original data set into segments where bad customers form the majority. These segments, known as Majority Bad Payment Segments (MBPS) are then used to train machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, C4.5, and Bayesian Network to identify high risk customers in advance. The authors compare their approach to the traditional approach of under sampling the majority class of good customers using a variety of metrics such as Hit Rate, Coverage and the Area under the Curve (AUC) metrics which have been designed to evaluate classification performance on imbalanced data sets. The results of our experimentation showed that the MBPS generally outperformed the under sampling method on all of these measures. Although MBPS has been used in this research in the context of a financial credit application, the technique is a generic one and can be used in any application domain that involves imbalanced data. © 2010, IGI Global.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

The results show that while some machine learning models can surpass the expert system's accuracy with statistical significance, most models do not. More interestingly, this happened only when the problem was treated as regression. In contrast, no machine learning model showed any statistically significant advantage over the expert system's accuracy when the same problem was treated as classification. Since the true nature of the class data was ordinal, the latter is the more appropriate setting. It is also shown that the answer to the question is highly dependent on the meter that is being used to define accuracy. © 2008.",Accuracy | Classification | Cohen's kappa | Credit scoring | Expert systems | Hit ratio | Machine learning models | Regression,33,0,,,,undefined,

Although there are many studies regarding financial decision-making problems, such as bankruptcyprediction and credit scoring, there is no research, to our knowledge, about dividend prediction or dividend policy forecasting using machine learning approaches in spite of the significance of dividends. For dealing with the above issues, we suggest a knowledge refinement model that can refine the multiple rules extracted through rule-based algorithms from dividend data sets using GA. The new technique, called 'GAKR (genetic algorithm knowledge refinement)', aims to combine the advantages of both knowledge consolidation and genetic algorithm. The experiments show that GAKR model always outperforms other models in the performance of dividend policy forecasting; we can predict future dividend policy more correctly than any other models. This enhancement in predictability of future dividend policy can significantly contribute to the valuation of a company, and hence from investors to financial managers to any decision makers of a company can make use of GAKR model for the better financing and investing decision makings which can lead to higher profits and firm values eventually. © 2008 IEEE.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

By comparing with the single classifier as the benchmark in terms of average prediction accuracy, the multiple classifiers only perform better in one of the three datasets. The diversified multiple classifiers trained by not only different classifier parameters but also different sets of training data perform worse in all datasets.

Using a data set from a German bank, we first examine the effects of combining a large number of base SVM on classification performance and robustness. The base models are trained on different sets of reduced client characteristics and may also use different kernels. Furthermore, using censored outputs of multiple SVM models leads to more reliable predictions in most cases. But there also remains a credit client subset that seems to be unpredictable.

Traditionally, logistic regression and discriminant analysis are the most widely used approaches to create scoring models in the industry. However, these methods are associated with quite a few limitations, such as being instable with high-dimensional data and small sample size, intensive variable selection effort and incapability of efficiently handling non-linear features. Most importantly, based on these algorithms, it is difficult to automate the modelling process and when population changes occur, the static models usually fail to adapt and may need to be rebuilt from scratch. In the last few years, the kernel learning approach has been investigated to solve these problems. However, the existing applications of this type of methods (in particular the SVM) in credit scoring have all focused on the batch model and did not address the important problem of how to update the scoring model on-line. This paper presents a novel and practical adaptive scoring system based on an incremental kernel method. With this approach, the scoring model is adjusted according to an on-line update procedure that can always converge to the optimal solution without information loss or running into numerical difficulties. Non-linear features in the data are automatically included in the model through a kernel transformation. This approach does not require any variable reduction effort and is also robust for scoring data with a large number of attributes and highly unbalanced class distributions. Moreover, a new potential kernel function is introduced to further improve the predictive performance of the scoring model and a kernel attribute ranking technique is used that adds transparency in the final model. Experimental studies using real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The bank that has the most accurate view of its credit risk will be the most profitable. One of the main pillars in the assessing credit risk is the estimated probability of default of each counterparty, i.e., the probability that a counterparty cannot meet its payment obligations in the horizon of one year. A credit rating system takes several characteristics of a counterparty as inputs and assigns this counterparty to a rating class. In essence, this system is a classifier whose classes lie on an ordinal scale. In this paper we apply linear regression ordinal logistic regression, and support vector machine techniques to the credit rating problem. The latter technique is a relatively new machine learning technique that was originally designed for the two-class problem. We propose two new techniques that incorporate the ordinal character of the credit rating problem into support vector machines.

Because in credit scoring areas we usually cannot label one customer as absolutely good who is sure to repay in time, or absolutely bad who will default certainly, our new fuzzy support vector machine treats every sample as both positive and negative classes, but with different memberships. By this way we expect the new fuzzy support vector machine to have more generalization ability, while preserving the merit of insensitive to outliers, as the fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) proposed in previous papers.

However, one of their main drawbacks is the inherent replication of isomorphic subtrees, as a result of which the produced classifiers might become too large to be comprehensible by the human experts that have to validate them. Alternatively, decision diagrams, a generalization of decision trees taking on the form of a rooted, acyclic digraph instead of a tree, have occasionally been suggested as a potentially more compact representation. Their application in machine learning has nonetheless been criticized, because the theoretical size advantages of subgraph sharing did not always directly materialize in the relatively scarce reported experiments on real-world data. Therefore, in this paper, starting from a series of rule sets extracted from three real-life credit-scoring data sets, we will empirically assess to what extent decision diagrams are able to provide a compact visual description.

For example, in several financial applications (loan approval, credit scoring, etc.) an applicant is asked to submit a processing fee with the application (Mookerjee and Mannino 1997). The processing fee may be used to validate the information entered in the application. From an economic standpoint, it is important that the cost of validating the information not exceed the processing fee. Traditional classification systems do not allow the decision maker to incorporate information acquisition cost constraint. We term the problem of designing a classification system, where information acquisition costs are considered, as the problem of classification with information acquisition cost constraint (CIACC). The CIACC problem is a NP hard problem and is very difficult to solve to optimality. Current computer-based medical diagnostic methods use neural networks, discriminant analysis and other machine learning approaches for medical diagnosis (Pendharkar et al. 1999). Most of these approaches do not allow the decision maker to incorporate the information acquisition cost constraints. For example, Turney (1995) argues that “the problem of cost-sensitive classification is medical diagnosis, where a doctor would like to balance the costs of various possible medical tests with the expected benefits of the tests for the patient.” Turney proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm and decision tree induction algorithm to develop a classification system that minimizes information acquisition and mis-classification costs.
