With the extensive research on consumer credit risk assessment in recent decades, the abundance of literature on this topic can be overwhelming for researchers. Therefore, this article aims to provide a more systematic and comprehensive analysis from three perspectives: classification algorithms, data traits, and learning methods. Firstly, the state-of-the-art classification algorithms are categorized into traditional single classifiers, intelligent single classifiers, hybrid and ensemble multiple classifiers. Secondly, considering the diversity of data traits in the credit dataset, data traits are divided into external structure information traits, data quality traits, data quantity traits, and internal information traits. Data traits-driven modeling framework based on multiple classifiers is proposed for solving credit risk assessment. Thirdly, considering the differences in data modeling methods, learning methods are classified into data status, label status, and structure form. Furthermore, model interpretability, model bias, model multi-pattern, and model fairness are discussed. Finally, the limitations and future research directions are presented.

Therefore, evaluating the influential ability of users has become crucial to promote or curb the dissemination of specific information. Existing centrality measures have produced varying results in identifying the most influential users, but it remains a challenge to identify the most influential users in a multifaceted and consistent way in social networks, especially when only a limited number of users can be nominated. To fill this gap, this work developed an evidential reasoning-based influential users evaluation (ERIUE) model that considers multiple sources of structural information in networks. Our proposed model collates information about users’ influential ability from multiple forms of centrality measures and maps their scores to different grades in an informative belief distribution. To determine the weight of each centrality, three types of information are considered: conflict of belief distributions, similarity of probability sets, and overlap of evaluations. The information is aggregated using the recursive evidential reasoning approach based on a formulated criterion hierarchy, thereby determining the influential ability of users. The applicability of our proposed model is demonstrated by comparing it with existing measures in three real-world social networks. Our proposed model is also applicable to relevant problems beyond identifying influential users, including preventing epidemic spread, cascade failure, and misinformation dissemination in social networks.",Decision-making | Evidential reasoning | Influential users | Social network,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,ESRC,undefined,Economic and Social Research Council

In the event of an emergency, due to human subjectivity, the operator cannot make accurate judgments on the instantaneous state of the nuclear power system based on experience alone, thus missing the best time for emergency repairs, which leads to accidents. This article is based on data-driven technology, for its application in the field of nuclear engineering preprocessing (missing value imputation, image denoising), prediction (critical heat flux prediction, prediction of parameters under LOCA accident, radiation concentration and radiation level prediction of nuclear power plant), classification (troubleshooting, flow pattern identification), design optimization (optimization of fuel loading mode in nuclear reactor core, design optimization of nuclear reactor radiation shielding) four aspects of review. Firstly, this paper finds that some models themselves have certain defects. Therefore, it is an important direction to select a relatively suitable algorithm for different problems in nuclear power plants. Secondly, in the prediction and classification of data-driven technology. Algorithmic models require a large amount of relevant data for training. However, due to the safety problems of the nuclear power plant itself, there are few abnormal data on accidents. Data-driven is a technology based on big data. The lack of real accident data will inevitably lead to inaccurate models. This paper reviews this aspect, and methods such as deep generative networks and separated data sets have good results. Finally, in terms of optimization techniques. Due to the many factors to be considered in the core fuel loading mode and reactor shielding design, conventional manual calculations are time-consuming and laborious. Genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are widely used in data-driven technology. Several variants have been developed in recent years. The application of some integrated models and the application of algorithm systems and frameworks for specific objects will have better results than using a single model.

The common goal of these techniques is to forecast the behaviour of the market, which can be translated into various classification tasks, such as, for instance, predicting the likelihood of companies’ bankruptcy or in fraud detection systems. However, it is often the case that real-world financial data are unbalanced, meaning that the classes’ distribution is not equally represented in such datasets. This gives the main issue since any Machine Learning model is trained according to the majority class mainly, leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore different data augmentation techniques to deal with very unbalanced financial data. We consider a number of publicly available datasets, then apply state-of-the-art augmentation strategies to them, and finally evaluate the results for several Machine Learning models trained on the sampled data. The performance of the various approaches is evaluated according to their accuracy, micro, and macro F1 score, and finally by analyzing the precision and recall over the minority class. We show that a consistent and accurate improvement is achieved when data augmentation is employed. The obtained classification results look promising and indicate the efficiency of augmentation strategies on financial tasks. On the basis of these results, we present an approach focused on classification tasks within the financial domain that takes a dataset as input, identifies what kind of augmentation technique to use, and then applies an ensemble of all the augmentation techniques of the identified type to the input dataset along with an ensemble of different methods to tackle the underlying classification.",Augmentation techniques | Ensemble method | Financial sector | Machine learning | Unbalanced data,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,EC,undefined,European Commission

To test our model, we designed an experiment using a randomized controlled trial design where participants compare signatures and detect forged signatures. Surprisingly, our study shows that XAI only has a small but significant impact on perceived explainability.

Moreover, by comparing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores, the GMM approach allows for the selection of the number of states of returns and index. An application to Bitcoin prices at 1-min and 1-s intervals shows the validity and usefulness of the proposed discretization approaches.

The credit risk rating of enterprises is therefore introduced to improve the efficiency of supervision. By analyzing the purposes of enterprise credit risk rating and the multiple demands for regulatory authorities, this paper offers a multi-classification ensemble model with hybrid decomposition strategy and two-stage multi-objective feature selection. First, an adaptive resampling technique is introduced into the hybrid decomposition strategy for multi-classification, so to appropriately allocate supervision resources in each credit risk class. Then, a two-stage multi-objective feature selection method is developed to combine the various demands of regulatory authorities for feature selection. In the first stage, results of multiple Filter feature selection methods are integrated as output to improve the performance of feature information; In the second stage, the feature information from the first stage is used as input to guide the Wrapper feature selection, which is based on the Improved Multi-objective Ant Colony Optimization. Finally, a real listed enterprise credit dataset of China is used to evaluate the performance of each module and the entire model. The empirical results show that the design of hybrid decomposition strategy and multi-objective feature selection can not only deal with the class-imbalanced problem during the decomposition process, but also take into account the balance of each demand well. More importantly, a desirable framework is set in this paper to simplify the process from imbalanced multi-classification to a balanced binary one.",Credit risk rating | Decomposition strategy | Ensemble model | Imbalanced multi-classification | Multi-objective feature selection,0,0,,,,2022KRW22,

Although GAs achieve superior performance, they are less efficient because most GAs are designed manually without intelligent parameter configuration to support scalable problem-solving strategies and learnable evolutionary operators. To address this issue, machine learning (ML) techniques have been integrated with GAs for operator and parameter selection, however, few studies have focused on intelligent genetic locus selection for influential operators in GAs. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an intelligent genetic locus selection algorithm that serves as the foundation of parameter configuration for critical operators. With the established framework, the Cross Information Synergistic Attention (CISA) model and the n-step proximal policy optimization (PPO) have been utilized to intelligently select the appropriate genetic locus for the most influential phase, i.e., crossover, during the evolutionary process. The proposed NeuroCrossover algorithm is validated on extensive COPs, including the traveling salesman problem, capacitated vehicle routing problem, and bin packing problem. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, which outperforms other methods in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and generalization. For instance, with the CISA, the average percentage gaps of our algorithm are 3.64% and 6.38% for instances in TSPLIB and CVRPLIB, respectively, obtaining gains of about 0.47% and 1.20% compared to those of GA.

Then, we show that the outer problem can be settled by solving the EDPD game problem.

Traditional anomaly detection methods detect anomalies with the same distribution effectively, but it is difficult to detect anomalies with changing distributions. In this paper, we propose a meta domain generalization based anomaly detection (MDGAD) framework to detect anomalies when distribution drifts. The framework first divides the data into a series of subsets. We measure the domain shift between sets with a class-sensitive distance metric, and merge similar sets, thereby generating different source domains to enhance domain diversity. We utilize the distribution shifts that existed on these source domains to simulate the distribution shifts that would be encountered when the model was applied. Meta learning is employed during training. First, the network is updated once on the meta-training set, and then another update is performed on the meta-verification set. These two gradients together determine the update direction of the network. At the same time, our framework will complete the domain alignment task on multiple source domains to extract domain invariant features and enhance the generalization of feature learning. We use Devnet as the base model and test our framework on 5 simulated data sets. The results confirm that our MDGAD outperforms current popular algorithms in detecting unknown anomalies and has better robustness.

The SMC approximation is done in a smooth manner so that the resulting approximate likelihoods can be numerically optimized to obtain parameter estimates. In the case with data aggregation, the use of SMC is made possible by a novel state space representation of the aggregated GARCH series. Through extensive simulation experiments, the proposed method is found to be computationally feasible and produce more accurate estimators of the model parameters compared with other recently published methods, especially in the case with aggregated data. In addition, the Hessian matrix of the minus logarithm of the approximate likelihood can be inverted to produce fairly accurate standard error estimates.

The recent applications involving deep learning in index tracking are more focused on the learned information rather than on the framework that consumes this information. The problem is that, until now, a way to enable the extension of the index tracking models that adopt machine learning was not yet proposed. Nowadays, the mathematical programming framework is more flexible when considering model extensions to build realistic portfolios. Thus, this study presents ways to combine generative adversarial networks (GANs) within this framework to generate market simulations incorporated into a base index tracking model. It was verified how the simulations generated by GANs can impact the out-of-sample performance of the portfolio and how to deal with their instability, by using real data from the Brazilian market. To achieve this, two evolutionary metaheuristics were proposed to solve the multiple scenario index tracking problem. The proposed evolutionary algorithms minimize the tracking errors of a portfolio in multiple market simulations generated by GANs. The performance of the proposed algorithms was compared against another evolutionary metaheuristic that solves the index tracking problem using historical data. It was possible to observe that the scenario-based dominance genetic algorithm (SDM-SBDGA-GAN) was able to perform better than the real data genetic algorithm (RDM-GA) and the sample average approximation genetic algorithm (SDM-SAAGA-GAN). These results open doors for new applications of synthetic data in the construction of portfolios using more realistic constraints and other tracking objectives.

Well-performing feature selection method is the key premise to improve accuracy of the credit evaluation model. At present, the feature selection methods applied to online credit scoring generally have shortcomings such as subjectivity, time consuming, low accuracy, etc. So it is urgent to introduce new schemes. Among the feature selection schemes in many fields, heuristic algorithm is widely recognized because of its advantages of high efficiency and accuracy, and especially BinSSA is an outstanding representative. However, BinSSA has the defects that it is easy to form extreme distribution in initialization, and is inefficient because there is a high probability of falling into local optimum during iteration.

In this paper, we propose a local binary social spider algorithm (LBSA), which introduces two local optimization strategies into BinSSA: opposition-based learning (OBL) and improved local search algorithm (ILSA). These strategies can help to improve the above defects. We conduct comparative experiments based on three typical online credit data sets and different algorithms, to verify the superior performance of LBSA. The experimental results validate that LBSA greatly reduces the redundancy of returned feature subsets, improves the iterative stability, and makes the credit scoring model more accurate and effective.",Credit scoring | Feature selection | Heuristic algorithm | Local optimization strategy,0,0,,,NSFC,2018TP1036,Scientific Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Education Department

They can provide a tradeoff between the performance of artificial neural networks and the interpretability of fuzzy inference systems expressed through fuzzy rules. Single techniques do not always provide the optimal performance, especially when the results are susceptible to changes in the data or hyperparameters. Therefore, ensemble learning can be used to build a more stable and robust model. In this paper, a systematic literature review of studies evaluating neuro-fuzzy ensembles was performed to highlight the importance of ensemble learning and its role in improving the performance of neuro-fuzzy systems. Many aspects are highlighted, including publication years, sources, contribution types, application domains, single neuro-fuzzy systems, ensemble techniques, and the overall performance and interpretability. A total of forty-eight articles published from 2000 to March 2022 addressing the use of neuro-fuzzy ensembles in different engineering applications were selected and analyzed. Results show that: (i) Takagi–Sugeno–Kang neuro-fuzzy systems are the most evaluated category, especially the ANFIS single. (ii) Homogeneous​ ensembles, in particular boosting, are the most investigated. (iii) Logical, relational and ANFIS ensembles are outperforming.

To this end, standard Monte Carlo simulations are often used, however, they cannot efficiently reconstruct the tail of the distribution which is essential in many applications. One possible remedy is to use the Multicanonical Monte Carlo method, an adaptive importance sampling scheme. In this method, one draws samples from an importance sampling distribution in a nonstandard form in each iteration, which is usually done via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). MCMC is inherently serial and therefore struggles with parallelism. In this paper, we present a new approach, which uses the Sequential Monte Carlo sampler to draw from the importance sampling distribution, which is particularly suited for parallel implementation.

We define and implement a credit loss model based on prospective point-in-time probabilities of default. We determine these probabilities of default and the credits' stage allocation through a credit stochastic simulation. This simulation is based on the estimation of transition matrices. Using data from 1981 to 2019, in a non-homogeneous Markov chain setting, we estimate transition matrices conditional on the global real gross domestic product growth. This allows considering the effects of the economic cycle, which are of great importance in bank management. Finally, we develop a robust optimization model that allows the bank manager to analyze the trade-off between the annual average portfolio income and the corresponding portfolio volatility. According to the proposed bi-objective model, we compute the efficient credit portfolios constructed based on 10-year maturity credits. We compare their structure to those generated by the IAS 39 and CECL accounting frameworks. The results indicate that the IFRS 9 and CECL frameworks generate efficient credit portfolios whose structure penalizes riskier-rated credits. In turn, the riskier efficient credit portfolios under the IAS 39 framework concentrate entirely on speculative-grade credits. This pattern is also encountered in efficient credit portfolios constructed based on credits with different maturities, namely 5 and 15 years. Moreover, the longer the maturity of the credits that enter into the composition of the efficient portfolios, the more the speculative-grade credits tend to be penalized.",CECL | credit risk | IAS 39 | IFRS 9 | stochastic simulation | transition matrices,0,0,repositoryam,Green,FCT,CEECIND/01010/2017,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia

Financial institutions stipulate lending agreements following a public recommendation and their individual information. The former is modeled by a reinforcement learning optimal policy that maximizes the system's fitness and gathers information on the economic environment. The policy recommendation directs economic actors to create credit relationships through the optimal choice between a low interest rate or a high liquidity supply. The latter, based on the agents’ balance sheet, allows determining the liquidity supply and interest rate that the banks optimally offer their clients within the market.

The source of the noise is often assumed to be stationary, however the severity or characteristics of noise may also be time-varying, which causes multiple sources of drift in the collected data. This study introduces a novel adaptive learning rate approach to improve learning when the observations from a non-stationary system is altered by an also non-stationary source of noise. As an example to this approach, we propose Persistence Aware Robust Learner (PeARL), an online learning method that utilizes a novel concept called persistence, which is a local noisiness estimation metric to measure the correspondence of a signal to discrete white noise. Making use of this metric, PeARL is able to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each observation during learning to reduce the effect of noise. With this level of control on the learning rate, noisy instances have less disruptive effect on the maintained estimate. We experimentally evaluate PeARL on (a) systematically generated synthetic data and (b) real-world data, including accelerometer readings collected from people (HASC2010corpus) and current measurements from electric motors collected within the scope of EU-funded research project iRel40. The experiments reveal a favorable region of noise rate, in which the proposed method achieves up to 40% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE).",Concept drift | Dynamic learning rate | Non-stationary noise | Parameter estimation | Stochastic learning,0,0,,,ECSEL,876659,Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership

This work discusses an alternative approach for extracting the thermodynamic and kinetic information from the so-called rate/generator matrix rather than the transition matrix. Although the rate matrix itself is built from the empirical transition matrix, it provides an alternative approach for estimating both thermodynamic and kinetic quantities, particularly in diffusive processes.

In recent years, researchers have employed machine learning techniques to develop prediction models by using numerical market data and textual messages on social networks as their primary sources of information. In this article, we propose User2Vec, a novel approach to improve stock market prediction accuracy, which contributes to more informed investment decision making. User2Vec is a unique method that recognizes the unequal impact of different user opinions on specific stocks, and it assigns weights to these opinions based on the accuracy of their associated social metrics. The User2Vec model begins by encoding each message as a vector. These vectors are then fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate an aggregated feature vector. Following this, a stacked bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) model provides the final representation of the input data over a period. LSTM-based models have shown promising results by effectively capturing the temporal patterns in time series market data. Finally, the output is fed into a classifier that predicts the trend of the target stock price for the next day. In contrast to previous attempts, User2Vec considers not only the sentiment of the messages, but also the social information associated with the users and the text content of the messages. It has been empirically proven that this inclusion provides valuable information for predicting stock direction, thereby significantly enhancing prediction accuracy. The proposed model was rigorously evaluated using various combinations of market data, encoded messages, and social features. The empirical studies conducted on the Dow Jones 30 stock market showed the model’s superiority over existing state-of-the-art models. The findings of these experiments reveal that including social information about users and their tweets, in addition to the sentiment and textual content of their messages, significantly improves the accuracy of stock market prediction.",deep learning | financial market emotion analysis | social network analysis | stock market prediction | user behavior modeling,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Methodology: This study employs a mixed method approach, combining qualitative techniques (a three-phase Delphi method) and quantitative methods (Best-Worst method [BWM] and MARKOV). MARKOV is applied here as an integrated Machine Learning-Markov approach to enhance the performance of KM implementation at universities. The relevant factors are processed through a Markov-based model, enabling the identification of future KMM factors. BWM is utilized to determine first-stage weights, and the Markovian weighted average of KMM factors is considered the optimal result. A questionnaire with open-ended questions is employed to collect accurate data, with thirty experts selected to participate in the survey. Findings: Nine factors were extracted from the literature review and Delphi method. The Markov model is employed to trace the priorities of KMM factors, serving as a predictive tool for modeling KM factors. The final weights of the factors are closely ranked as follows: (1) Information Technology; (2) applying knowledge; (3) structure; (4) Measuring knowledge; (5) culture; (6) Sharing knowledge; (7) leadership style; (8) Maintaining knowledge; and (9) Collecting knowledge.

Most investors may have inconsistent preferences for different assets; therefore, the reward function needs to be designed to balance exploration (allocating part of the investment to searching among other alternative portfolios) and exploitation (concentrating the investment on the historically best portfolio). The study consists of developing a two-stage investing strategy that uses the supervised adaptive decision tree approach to build a pool of candidate portfolios and the reinforcement LinUCB algorithm to derive a portfolio update rule with respect to a specific utility function. The two-stage strategy has been tested on CSI300 constitute stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

One of the great challenges in this application is modeling the correlation among assets in the portfolio. However, current studies cannot deal well with this challenge because it is difficult to analyze complex nonlinearity in the correlation. This paper proposes a policy network that models the nonlinear correlation by utilizing the self-attention mechanism to better tackle this issue. In addition, a deterministic policy gradient recurrent reinforcement learning method based on Monte Carlo sampling is constructed with the objective function of cumulative return to train the policy network. In most existing reinforcement learning-based studies, the state transition probability is generally regarded as unknown, so the value function of the policy can only be estimated. Based on financial backtest experiments, we analyze that the state transition probability is known in the portfolio, and value function can be directly obtained by sampling, further theoretically proving the optimality of the proposed reinforcement learning method in the portfolio. Finally, the superiority and generality of our approach are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the cryptocurrency dataset, S&P 500 stock dataset, and ETF dataset.",Asset correlations | Deep reinforcement learning | Portfolio selection,2,0,,,NSFC,62007017,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Existing approaches in the banking industry dismiss the contagion risk across loan networks and need extensive knowledge with sophisticated financial expertise. Regarding the issues, we propose a novel approach to predict critical firms for stemming contagion risk in the bank industry with deep reinforcement learning integrated with high-order graph message-passing networks.

However, attacks on cloud computing pose a serious threat to confidentiality and data integrity. Therefore, there is a need for a proper mechanism for detecting cloud intrusions. In this paper, we have proposed a cloud intrusion detection system (IDS) that is focused on boosting the classification accuracy by improving feature selection and weighing the ensemble model with the crow search algorithm (CSA). The feature selection is handled by combining both filter and automated models to obtain improved feature sets. The ensemble classifier is made up of machine and deep learning models such as long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, and a fast learning network (FLN). The proposed ensemble model’s weights are generated with the CSA to obtain better prediction results. Experiments are executed on the NSL-KDD, Kyoto, and CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 datasets. The simulation shows that the suggested system attained more satisfactory results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure than conventional approaches. The detection rate and false alarm rate (FAR) of different attack types was more efficient for each dataset.

However, training deep reinforcement learning models with the data set generated in a certain stage may lead to catastrophic forgetting of trained models, that is, when training models on the new data set, the performance of models will be seriously degraded on the old data set. Therefore, we construct the balanced incremental deep Q-network based on variational autoencoder data augmentation (BIDQN-VADA) model for customer credit scoring. First, the original training set is processed by the random undersampling method to obtain the balanced training set, in which the initial deep Q-network model is trained. Then, the balanced training subset with a fixed number of samples is selected from the original training set, and these samples are augmented by the variational autoencoder data augmentation technology to obtain the balanced augmented training subset. Finally, the balanced training subset and balanced augmented training subset are stored in data stream cache according to the first-in first-out principle for incrementally updating parameters of the deep Q-network model. In order to verify the performance of the model, we conduct a series of experiments on eight real-world customer credit scoring data sets. The experimental results show that the BIDQN-VADA model can achieve the best customer credit scoring performance by combining the balance, incremental and data augmentation process at the same time. More importantly, the performance of the BIDQN-VADA model is significantly better than the other seven classification models.",Customer credit scoring | Data augmentation | Deep Q-network | Incremental deep reinforcement learning | Variational autoencoder,0,0,,,NSFC,2020JDJQ0021,National Natural Science Foundation of China

To address this, we propose Meta-learning-based Weighted Cluster Ensemble (MetaWCE), which learns the weights-data relation automatically and sets adaptive CE weights. Specifically, metadata is employed to describe data characteristics at a dataset level. To bridge metadata and weights, a meta-learning strategy is introduced to simulate the weighting process to ensure that relation between weights and metadata can be learned to directly optimize the ensemble performance in an end-to-end manner.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors embarked on a theoretical treatise as advocated by scholars (Cornelissen, 2019; Barney, 2018; Cornelissen, 2017; Smithey Fulmer, 2012; Bacharach, 1989; Whetten, 1989; Weick,1989). Towards this end, theoretical argumentative logic was incrementally used to build an integrated perspective on the deployment of learning and AI-based persuasive technologies. This was carried out with strategic real options investment perspective to secure customer futures on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites. Findings: M-commerce apps and e-commerce sites have been deploying ML and AI-based tools (referred to as persuasive technologies), to nudge customers for increased and quicker purchase. The primary objective was to increase engagement time of customers (at an individual level), grow the number of customers (at market level) and increase firm revenue (at an organizational level). The deployment of any persuasive technology entailed increased investment (cash outflow) but was also expected to increase the level of revenue and margin (cash inflow). Given the dynamics of market and the emergent nature of persuasive technologies, ascertaining favourable cash flow was challenging. Real options strategy provided a robust theoretical perspective to time the persuasive technology-related investment in stages. This helped managers to be on time with loading customer purchase with increased temporal immediacy. A real options investment space involving six spaces has also been developed in this conceptual work. These were Never Invest, Immediately Investment, Present-day Investment Possibility, Possibly Invest Later, Invest Probably Later and Possibly Never Invest. Research limitations/implications: The foundations of this study domain encompassed work done by an eclectic mix of scholars like from technology management (Siggelkow and Terwiesch, 2019a; Porter and Heppelmann, 2014), real options (Trigeorgis and Reuer, 2017; Luehrman, 1998a, 1998b), marketing intelligence and planning (Appel et al., 2020; Thaichon et al., 2019; Thaichon et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2019) and strategy from a demand positioning school of thought (Adner and Zemsky, 2006). Practical implications: The findings would help managers to comprehend what level of investments need to be done in a staggered manner. The phased way of investing towards the deployment of ML and AI-based persuasive technologies would enable better monetization of customer futures. This would aid marketing managers for increased customer engagement at the individual level, fast monetization of customer futures and increased number of customers and consumption on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites.

We also look at the advantages and disadvantages of local explanation methods and how well they work in practical settings. The difficulties of using local explanation techniques are also covered, including computing complexity and the trade-off between precision and interpretability. Our findings demonstrate that local explanation techniques can boost industrial AI models’ transparency and interpretability and give insightful information about them.

First, the RandomSample-SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method is designed to perform class imbalance processing on network attack traffic collected from big data traffic; second, the feature importance of the attack traffic in different classification layers is calculated and ranked separately using the LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model, and the optimal feature values are selected through retraining; finally, the obtained feature values are used for model training and the most optimal model is obtained by optimizing the hyperparameters with TuneGridSearchCV (Tune's Grid Search Cross Validation). The results of simulation experiments show that the method in this paper can effectively extract features from big data traffic.

Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) decomposed orthogonal subseries have been predicted using Random Forests (RFs). Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) model is used to combine those predictions to form a hybrid predictor. Improvement in prediction performance has been observed using kernel functions.

The improved ensemble learning model is a promising solution to mitigate this challenge. In this paper, an improved multi-class imbalanced data classification framework is proposed by combining the Focal Loss with Boosting model (FL-Boosting). By addressing the confusion of the second-order derivation of Focal Loss in the traditional ensemble learning model, the proposed model achieves a more efficient and accurate classification of the imbalanced data. More specifically, a Highly Adaptive Focal Loss (HAFL) is proposed to ensure that the model maintains lasting attention to the minority samples, which could be combined with boosting model to build HAFL-Boosting to achieve better performance. The framework has the scalability to adapt to different situations according to typical ensemble learning algorithms such as LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost. In addition, to implement the application of the proposed framework on deep models, a two-stage classification method combining ConvNeXt with the improved boosting model is proposed, which could improve the recognition ability to high-dimensional imbalanced data. We evaluate the HAFL-Boosting and the two-stage class imbalance classification method by ablation experiments and benchmark experiments, which demonstrated that the proposed methods obviously improved the scores on several evaluation indexes.

The product quality prediction method based on big data is prone to overfitting in the small sample and high dimensional data environment, and the model generalization performance is poor. In order to solve the above problems, this paper conducts research in two aspects of data augmentation and model optimization respectively. At the data augmentation level, a data generation model RVAE-CGAN is proposed, RVAE constrains the value space of GAN and eliminates the influence of outliers in the original data on the quality of generated samples. Using DBSCAN to cluster raw data to generate conditional vectors for guiding sample generation, and finally obtain high-quality generated samples. At the model optimization level, a product quality prediction model PPO-SVR is proposed. The PPO method is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the SVR model and improve the prediction effect of the model. RVAE-CGAN and PPO-SVR models are combined, and RVAE-CGAN is used to expand the number of samples to train PPO-SVR. The experimental results show that the product quality prediction model constructed based on RVAE-CGAN and PPO-SVR outperforms the BP neural network prediction model trained on mixed data. Therefore, the combination of data augmentation and model optimization proposed in this paper can significantly improve the prediction effect of the product quality prediction model in the small sample data environment.",Conditional generative adversarial networks | Proximal policy optimization | Quality prediction | Robust variational auto encoder | Small samples | Support vector regression,1,0,,,,2018AAA0101800,Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai

Results: Various machine learning libraries released deterministic counterparts to the nondeterministic algorithms. We evaluated the effect of these algorithms on determinism and runtime. Based on these results, we formulated a set of requirements for deterministic machine learning and developed a new software solution, the mlf-core ecosystem, which aids machine learning projects to meet and keep these requirements.

With the effect of recent trends, such as the use of machine learning, data mining, and reinforcement learning methods, the maintenance decision has been a dynamic issue depending on system conditions. An expert may execute the maintenance or wait for the next periodic maintenance due to lack of maintenance workers, tools or budget, resources, etc., although the intelligent method predicts a failure approaching. Even sometimes, he/she may ignore the current periodic maintenance. Our method allows making some changes in the maintenance plan systematically. It integrates the results of preventive and predictive maintenance policies, and as different from the literature, it allows ignoring some maintenance actions depending on the maintenance resource levels in a decision table. Such a strategy helps to allocate limited resources to maintenance actions reasonably. We conducted an extensive simulation study on a real-life dataset. The preventive maintenance period is determined using classical approaches such as Weibull analysis. A machine learning algorithm is utilized to predict the type of failure. We have analyzed the performance of the proposed decision table approach under a variety of scenarios and with different parameter settings. We also showed the effect of parameter settings and the marginal utility of each maintenance policy. In addition, the approach provides several choices for planners. As a result, the proposed approach improves the system's sustainability compared to traditional policies.",Decision support | Lookup table | Machine learning | Resource constraint | Simulation | Weibull analysis,1,0,,,,undefined,

Although many sophisticated algorithms have been derived, most of them overlook the importance of gradient information. From this perspective, the difficulty of learning from imbalanced data streams lies in the fact that the gradient estimated on an uneven class distribution is not informative enough to reflect the critical pattern of each class. To this end, we propose to assign higher weights on the training samples whose gradients are close to the gradient of corresponding typical samples, thus highlighting the important samples in minority classes and suppressing the noisy samples in majority classes. Such an idea can be combined with Mixup, which exploits the interpolation information of data to further compensate for the information of sample space that the typical samples do not provide and expand the role of the proposed re-weighting scheme. Experiments on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR data streams and long-tailed MiniPlaces data stream show that the resulting method, termed MixGradient, boosts the generalization performance of DNNs under different imbalance ratios and achieves up to 10% accuracy improvement.",Deep learning | Imbalanced data streams | Mixup | Sample gradient | Typical samples,0,0,,,NKRDPC,2020AAA0108104,National Key Research and Development Program of China

It is shown that the adoption of deep learning is not only affected by computational complexity, lacking big data architecture, lack of transparency (black-box), skill shortage, and leadership commitment, but also by the fact that DL does not outperform traditional ML models in the case of structured datasets with fixed-length feature vectors. Deep learning should be regarded as a powerful addition to the existing body of ML models instead of a “one size fits all” solution. The results strongly suggest that gradient boosting can be seen as the go-to model for predictions on structured datasets within business analytics.

A majority of the current approaches to estimate the effective porosity of the reservoir rocks from well logs are based on the information of the Density-Neutron logs. These approaches usually resulted in the inaccurate estimation of the rock porosity particularly in the naturally fractured carbonates or dolomite rocks. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based effective porosity is independent of the rock matrix and mineralogy, on contrary it depends on the number of hydrogen nuclei in the pore spaces of the rock. In this study, we have used six machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the NMR based effective porosity in carbonate rocks. The ML models to predict the effective porosity includes deep neural networks (DNN), random forest regressor (RF), decision trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and adaptive gradient boosting (AdaBoost). These models were trained on the geophysical well logs such as Gamma ray log (GR), caliper log (Cali), neutron porosity log (NPHI), photoelectric factor log (PE), and bulk density log (RHOB). A total of 4002 data points were obtained from the five wells located in the carbonate field. The tuning of ML models hyperparameters were conducted using a ‘GridSearchCv’ method. Furthermore, the K-fold cross-validation criterion was implemented to improve the accuracy of the ML models. The ML models performances were evaluated using multiple graphical and goodness of fit tests including prediction cross-plots, average absolute percentage error (AAPE), root means square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) methods. The prediction results showed that the DNN, RF, and XGB models performed better than the other implemented ML techniques. These methods resulted in a significantly low error and high (R2). The achieved accuracy was above 85% when validated on a blind dataset. This study also offered an empirical model that can be used to quickly estimate the NMR based effective porosity using afore-mentioned well logs. The model can also be used as a standalone package that can be coupled with any logging software for quick evaluation of NMR based effective porosity.",Carbonate reservoir | Deep learning | Machine learning | Mathematical model | Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,2,0,,,KAUST,BAS/1/1351-01-01,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology

In particular, we employ transfer entropy (TE) as a proxy for the causal effect between the two assets considering that one of the most widely used methods, Granger causality, requires strict assumptions. When adopting TE, we find that asymmetric information flow arising between assets depends on macroeconomic phases. The stock and bond markets affected the CB market prior to and during the global financial crisis, respectively. In the post-crisis period, we find no meaningful information exchange between CBs and other investment assets concerning their return series. However, we observe a significant cause–effect relationship between CBs and stocks in the rise–fall patterns of their price series. The findings suggest that the appearance of one-directional information flow depends on macroeconomic conditions and the level of data, for example, return series or price fluctuations. Accordingly, investors could exploit this pattern predictability in their portfolio management. In addition, policymakers must closely monitor the information flow among the three markets. When any two markets exchange information in a state of strong market integration, unbalanced regulation between them could lead to market distortions and regulatory arbitrage.",,0,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

The phase space of the process was identified based on the assumption that at any given moment the vehicle remains in one of four states, namely, task execution, awaiting a transport task, periodic maintenance, or repair. Vehicle functional readiness and technical suitability indices were adopted as performance measures for the technical system. A simulation model based on Monte Carlo methods was developed to determine the changes in the operational states. The occurrence of the periodic maintenance state is strictly determined by a planned and preventive strategy of operation applied within the analysed system. Other states are implementations of stochastic processes. The original source code was developed in the MATLAB environment to implement the model. Based on estimated probabilistic characteristics, the authors validated 16 simulation models resulting from all possible cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) that satisfied the condition of a proper match to empirical data. Based on the simulated operation process for a sample of 19 vehicles over the assumed 20-year forecast horizon, it was possible to determine the functional readiness and technical suitability indices. The relative differences between the results of all simulation models and the results obtained through the semi-Markov model did not exceed 6%. The best-fit model was subjected to sensitivity analysis in terms of the dependence between functional readiness and technical suitability indices on vehicle operation intensity. As a result, the proposed simulation system based on Monte Carlo methods turned out to be a useful tool in analysing the current operation process of means of transport in terms of forecasts related to a current environment, as well as when attempting its extrapolation.",maintenance | Monte Carlo algorithm | reliability analysis | semi-Markov process | simulation approach | transport system,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,WAT,UGB 22-835,Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna

Furthermore, due to the lack of transparency behind their behavior, users need more understanding of how these models make specific decisions, especially in complex state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Complex machine learning systems utilize less transparent algorithms, thereby exacerbating the problem.

The impact of an unexpected event on any member of the supply chain network will quickly affect the upstream and downstream enterprises connected to it, which will then cause risk to the whole supply chain network. Therefore, this paper proposes a new supply chain risk diffusion model based on a partial mapping relationship between two-layer complex networks, which aims to study the impact of risk awareness and risk information disclosure awareness. In this model, one layer represents the propagation of resources in the supply chain network, while the other layer represents the diffusion of the supply chain-related information in the social network. In addition, it divides enterprises into two types, namely with risk-aware enterprises or non-risk-aware enterprises. The model introduces the concept of partial mapping, meaning there are just mapping relationships between only partial pairs of nodes in the two-layered network. If a pair of nodes have the correspondence, the enterprises obtaining the information will take effective measures to avoid infection. This partial mapping relationship reflects the differences in enterprises’ awareness of risk information disclosure. After that, by building a probability transition tree, we establish the risk state transition equation in detail using the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMC) and analyze the established equations to deduce the propagation threshold of their supply chain risks analytically. The results show that the propagation threshold is related to network topology, the risk information disclosure awareness of enterprises, and the risk awareness of enterprises. Specifically, the stronger the risk information disclosure awareness and the greater the risk awareness of enterprises, the smaller the scale of supply chain risks eventually formed and the lower the threshold of risk outbreak. In addition, the influence of information disclosure awareness on the final developed risk scale is more significant than that of risk awareness. Finally, the simulation results further verify the model's feasibility.",Complex networks | Partial mapping | Risk awareness | Risk propagation | Supply chain risk,1,0,,,MOE,19JHQ091,Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China

The aim is to explore frame aggregation for the high throughput (HT) users such as 802.11n type, avoiding the drawback of mixed contention from the presence of the coexisting legacy users such as 802.11 g. It has been demonstrated that restricting an access point (AP) to serve only similar type of users may lead suboptimal performance both in terms of throughput and service coverage as well. Additionally, frame aggregation can not perform well under this common contending scenario. Therefore, a cluster based association management has been proposed which uses frame aggregation and suitably designs a user-AP association where both HT users and legacy users coexist and access services from a common AP. A mathematical formulation of the proposed approach has been developed followed by a greedy solution. Extensive simulations have been performed that establish the fact that the proposed approach judiciously associates the heterogeneous users to the selected target AP and outperforms the other existing approaches including some benchmark algorithms.

Different classification techniques generate a continuous number between a and b, usually between 0 and 1; thus, the optimal cut-off value(s) must be carefully selected to discriminate classes precisely. The decision is about setting a threshold value and transforming the continuous score into a binary output. Therefore, in addition to using the so-called sophisticated classification methods to have a more accurate classification, there is a need to identify and choose the optimal threshold value(s). However, the latter has not been thoroughly investigated. Hence, this study proposes an approach based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Networks (NNs) to automatically find customized cut-off values, considering different performance criteria and given datasets. Since credit scoring is a binary classification problem, two popular credit scoring datasets, namely “Australian” and “German” credit datasets, are used to test the proposed approach. Our numerical results revealed that the proposed GA-NN model could successfully find customized acceptance thresholds, considering predetermined performance criteria, including Accuracy, Estimated Misclassification Cost (EMC), and Area under ROC Curve (AUC) for the tested datasets. Furthermore, the best-obtained results and the paired-samples t-test results show that utilizing the customized cut-off points leads to a more accurate classification than the commonly-used threshold value of 0.5.",classification problem | credit scoring | genetic algorithm | optimal cut-off point | optimal threshold value | performance criteria,0,0,,,,undefined,

We characterize the salient properties of matryoshkan matrices that allow us to compute these moments in closed form at a specific time without computing the entire path of the process. This simplifies the computation of the polynomial process moments significantly. Through our method, we derive explicit expressions for both transient and steady-state moments of this class of Markov processes. We demonstrate the applicability of this method through explicit examples such as shot noise processes, growth-collapse processes, ephemerally self-exciting processes, and affine stochastic differential equations from the finance literature.

As a result, they may become rigid and unable to adjust to changing situations or unforeseen events. RL can overcome these drawbacks. RL learns by exploring the environment randomly and based on experience, it continues to expand its knowledge. Many researchers are working on RL-based energy management systems (EMS). RL is utilized in energy applications such as optimizing energy use in smart buildings, hybrid automobiles, smart grids, and managing renewable energy resources. RL-based energy management in renewable energy contributes to achieving net zero carbon emissions and a sustainable environment. In the context of energy management technology, RL can be utilized to optimize the regulation of energy systems, such as building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, to reduce energy consumption while maintaining a comfortable atmosphere. EMS can be accomplished by teaching an RL agent to make judgments based on sensor data, such as temperature and occupancy, to modify the HVAC system settings. RL has proven beneficial in lowering energy usage in buildings and is an active research area in smart buildings. RL can be used to optimize energy management in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) by learning an optimal control policy to maximize battery life and fuel efficiency.

As the stock return distributions exhibit skewness, kurtosis, and heavy-tailedness, for asset performance evaluation through the data envelopment analysis (DEA), we assume that the asset returns follow a pure jump Lévy process. For this purpose, two risk measures are provided as value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional VaR (CVaR). To deal with negative values, the range directional measure (RDM) model is utilized in the appropriate Lévy process, and inefficiency measurements are compared. Moreover, the asset price jumps have significant effects on the input and output of DEA models, risk measures, mean returns, and efficiency scores. In this regard, there are two optimization problems integrating DEA based on the variance gamma (VG) Lévy process, in which the input and output are stochastic. One of these two problems is a multi-objective optimization model that evaluates more reliable efficiency scores than the other models. For this purpose, the VG parameters are estimated through the moments estimation method in order to analyze seven companies listed in the Tehran stock exchange (TSE). Finally, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test is conducted.

This research proposed a novel protocol in data transmission using fuzzy rule-based secure transmission with data optimization technique using deep reinforcement neural network by wireless communication. This technique for data transmission will reduce the credit risk and enhances the data optimization by fuzzy rule-based protocol with DRNN. The logic utilized is fuzzy logic, which is a multi-valued logic with truth values for variables ranging from 0 to 1. When truth values range from entirely true to completely false, it is used. The end user's searching experience is improved by fuzzy logic-based semantic search, which finds and retrieves exact matching files for relevant search files provided by user. When exact matches aren't possible, method leverages semantic similarities to determine most relevant matches. A grading method is utilized to minimize number of false positives. For this, proposed technique was used, which may decide on a collection of suitable storage servers on which the data must be saved and resulting in a reduction in execution time while maintaining a higher level of security.

Consequently, in this paper, a horizontal federated learning paradigm is used to protect the local private data of each participant and collaborate to train a powerful shared global model. However, in the collaborative training process, heterogeneous data distributions can result in insufficient learning of the model. To overcome this issue, we propose the federated knowledge transfer (FedKT) method, which exploits the advantages of fine-tuning and knowledge distillation to effectively extract generic and specific knowledge from the early layers and outputs of the global model, respectively, thus improving the learning performance of the local models. We adopt five credit datasets and four performance measures to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), by the year 2050, farming in the world should grow by about one-third above current levels. Therefore, farmers have intensively used fertilizers to promote crop growth and yields, which has adversely affected the nutritional improvement of foodstuffs. To address challenges related to productivity, environmental impact, food safety, crop losses, and sustainability, mobile robots in agriculture have proliferated, integrating mainly path planning and crop information gathering processes. Current agricultural robotic systems are large in size and cost because they use a computer as a server and mobile robots as clients. This article reviews the use of mobile robotics in farming to reduce costs, reduce environmental impact, and optimize harvests. The current status of mobile robotics, the technologies employed, the algorithms applied, and the relevant results obtained in smart farming are established. Finally, challenges to be faced in new smart farming techniques are also presented: environmental conditions, implementation costs, technical requirements, process automation, connectivity, and processing potential. As part of the contributions of this article, it was possible to conclude that the leading technologies for the implementation of smart farming are as follows: the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile robotics, artificial intelligence, artificial vision, multi-objective control, and big data. One technological solution that could be implemented is developing a fully autonomous, low-cost agricultural mobile robotic system that does not depend on a server.",intelligent agriculture | IoT in agriculture | mobile robotics in agriculture | path planning in agriculture | precision agriculture | smart farming | unmanned ground vehicle in agriculture,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,CIAICO/2021/064,

Reliable detection of such temporal dependencies is crucial for scientific investigation. A common model is the Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP), whose impact function naturally encodes a causal structure in Granger causality. However, the vast majority of existing methods use a transformed standard MHP intensity with a constant baseline, which may be inconsistent with real-world data. On the other hand, modeling irregular and unknown background dynamics directly is a challenge, as one struggles to distinguish the effect of mutual interaction from that of fluctuations in background dynamics. In this paper, we address the short-term temporal dependency detection issue. We show that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for cross-impact from MHP has an error that can not be eliminated, but may be reduced by an order of magnitude using a heterogeneous intensity not for the target HP but for the interacting HP. Then we propose a robust and computationally-efficient modification of MLE that does not rely on the prior estimation of the heterogeneous intensity and is thus applicable in a data-limited regime (e.g., few-shot, unrepeated observations).

Previous works developed a binary classification prediction model (either default or repaid loan). Repaid loans include loans being repaid on or after the loan deadline date. DefBDet, on the other hand, is a novel model, it can predict a loan status based on a multi-classification bases rather than a binary class bases. Hence, it can additionally identify expected late repaid loans, so that special conditions are assigned before loan being approved. This study employs seven different Machine Learning models, using a real-world dataset from 2009-2022 consisting of around 255k loan requests. Statistical measures such as Recall, Precision, and F-measure have been used for models' evaluation. Results show that Random Forest has achieved the highest performance of 85%.",Default borrowers | default loans | loan risks | machine learning models | prediction model,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,KSU,undefined,King Saud University

Fortunately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has mandated that large institutional investors publicly disclose the positions held by them at the end of a quarter, within the following 45 days. We then ask the question 'Given our access to snapshots of positions held by large investors, can we extract alpha by approximating their aggregate behaviour?' In this paper, we introduce a stock recommendation model driven by the aggregate behaviour of institutional investors. We interpret stocks as the states of a Markov chain. The corresponding state transition matrix is defined based on the aggregate behaviour of investors. By designing the transition matrix to hold for aperiodicity and irreducibility, the steady state distribution of this chain is treated as a ranked list of stocks. We build a long only, equally weighted portfolio of stocks to trade using these recommendations. We observe that the returns on this portfolio beat existing models in the literature, and standard hedge fund indices both in terms of annualised returns and Sharpe ratio.",algorithmic trading | econophysics | institutional investors | markov process | Stochastic modelling,0,0,,,,undefined,

One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods.

At present, research on supply chain network interruption risk mainly focuses on the static level, such as concept definition, type identification and quantitative analysis. The existing research on enterprise status from the perspective of operational capability has an extensive description of the details, which cannot truly reflect the propagation law of supply chain network interruption risk. On this basis, this paper discusses subdividing enterprise operational capability into five states combined with an analysis of degrees of interruption. This paper also uses a discrete-time Markov chain and dynamic Bayesian network to simulate the changes in individual enterprises′ operational capabilities and the changes in their operational capabilities following their fragility and recoverability after an interruption event. This paper asserts that the interruption risk of enterprises conforms to the characteristics of the infectious disease model. There are interruption risk-susceptible individuals, latent individuals, infected individuals and immune individuals who have been removed free of risks and therefore have a certain interruption risk immunity in the supply chain network. Considering the degrees to which enterprises divide interruptions, this study divides “infected individuals” into “lightly infected individuals” and “severely infected individuals”. Thus, the four individuals in the infectious disease model, SHIR, are extended to five individuals, which creatively correspond to the five operational states of enterprises, and a new supply chain network interruption propagation model is constructed. The first part of this paper summarizes the research of related scholars, clarifying the research basis and innovation of this paper. In terms of theoretical application, this paper considers the discrete-time Markov chain and infectious disease model; in terms of the main subjects, individual enterprises and affiliated enterprises are taken into consideration. At the variable control level, enterprises′ operational capabilities have been taken as a variable, and regarding the research method, it combines analysis and numerical simulation for analysis. The second part of this paper discusses constructing a model of individual enterprises′ operational state change based on the Markov process and a dynamic model of supply chain network disruption risk propagation based on the infectious disease model. First, the impact of enterprises′ vulnerability and resilience on individual enterprises′ operational capabilities under interruption events are simulated, and then a dynamic model of interruption risk propagation combined with an infectious disease model to simulate the impact of chain reaction on enterprises′ operational capabilities in a supply chain network is constructed. The third part of this paper discusses the interruption propagation process and its related properties. For individual enterprises, vulnerability and recoverability have a certain impact on their operational abilities, but ultimately, the system reaches a stable state. For affiliated enterprises, determining if there is an interruption risk propagation in their supply chain network is closely related to the interruption risk transmission threshold. In the end, the system tends to be globally stable, while the density of individual enterprises is affected by parameters. The fourth part of the paper carries out a numerical simulation analysis. First, simulation software is used to simulate the changes in individual enterprises′ operational capability status over time under the influence of vulnerability and resilience. The experimental results show that enterprises′ operational capabilities are affected by the interaction of vulnerability and resilience, and the whole system tends to be stable over time. Second, a simulation analysis of the interruption risk equilibrium point is carried out from both risk-free and risky aspects. The experimental results show that under different interruption risk thresholds, a risk-free stable state and a risky stable state are formed, and they are globally asymptotically stable. Finally, the influence of some important parameters on enterprises′ individual density in a stable state are discussed. The results show that, (1) in the stable state, an enterprise′s density is related to the incubation period, mild and severe infection period, infection rate and mutual conversion rate. (2) The incubation period and mild and severe infection periods have positive effects on the threshold, and the three parameters promote each other. The fifth part analyses the sensitivity of the interruption risk infection threshold. The results show that the infection rates of latent individuals and mildly and severely infected individuals have a positive impact on the threshold, and the three parameters are independent of each other. The subdivision of enterprise status helps to grasp the operational capability more accurately and has a certain practical significance for enterprises to comprehensively identify the interruption risk, grasp their own operational status and formulate prevention and control strategies according to the state transfer law to improve the anti-interruption risk capability of the whole supply chain network. According to enterprises′ operational capabilities, the infected individuals are divided into mildly infected individuals and severely infected individuals, which can describe the transmission law of interruption risk in the supply chain network more accurately. The obtained interruption risk propagation law can not only help enterprises better understand their own operational states and their supply chain environment but also provide a basis for them to replace interruption risk management and control strategies in real-time according to their state changes. The detailed description of the enterprise state combined with the interruption degree can provide ideas for studying the law of interruption risk propagation when the enterprise state is continuous.",Epidemic model | Markov modelling | Propagation of disruption risk | Ripple effect | Supply chain network,0,0,,,NPOPSS,20GLB114,Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province

The reason for the lack of publications that utilize Stacked LSTM-based models in credit scoring lies exactly in the fact that the deep learning algorithm is tailored to predict the next value of the time series, and credit scoring is a classification problem. The challenge and novelty of this approach involved the necessary adaptation of the credit scoring dataset to suit the time sequence nature of LSTM-based models.

The Bayesian treatment is known to improve predictive uncertainty calibration, but previously proposed Bayesian GBM methods are either computationally expensive, or resort to crude approximations. Variational inference is often used to implement Bayesian neural networks, but is difficult to apply to GBMs, because the decision trees used as weak learners are non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose to implement Bayesian GBMs using variational inference with soft decision trees, a fully differentiable alternative to standard decision trees introduced by Irsoy et al. Our experiments demonstrate that variational soft trees and variational soft GBMs provide useful uncertainty estimates, while retaining good predictive performance.

To survive in such competitive markets, new companies need a robust credit-scoring model. However, building a reliable model requires large stable data. The challenge is that datasets are often small, covering only a few months (short-period datasets). Therefore, this study proposes a modified binning method, namely changing a variable’s values into two groups with the smallest distribution differences possible. Modified binning can maintain data trends to avoid future shifting. The simulation was conducted using a real dataset from Indonesian Fintech, comprising 44,917 borrower-level observations with 396 variables. To match the actual conditions, the first three months of data were allocated for modeling and the remaining for testing. Implementing modified binning and logistics regression to testing data results in a more stable score band than standard binning. Compared with other classifier methods, the proposed method obtained the best AUC results on the testing data (0.73). In addition, the proposed method is highly applicable as it can provide a straightforward explanation to upper management or regulators.

In this article, a novel approach is proposed for performing load identification which consists of three main parts: features extraction considering decomposition-transformation strategy, appropriate feature screening, and employing a suitable classification strategy for performance improvement. The proposed approach first decomposes a load current into multiple modes by utilizing an adaptive signal decomposition technique, namely, variational mode decomposition (VMD), followed by the determination of the auto-correlograms of the modes. Multiple features are extracted from the obtained modes and their respective auto-correlograms. Postfeature extraction, combinations of multiple feature ranking (FR) techniques via union and intersection strategies are explored in contrast to employing only a single FR technique as prevalent in existing literature in NILM. Finally, considering the selected features by above stated FR combinations, a heterogeneous classifier strategy is adopted for performing classification that outperforms a single classifier as well as random forest classifiers on account of its heterogeneous structure. For further performance improvement, a surrogate-based optimization technique is utilized for determining the appropriate hyperparameter values in contrast to manual tuning which is prominent in existing works.

However, the security issue is challenged for multiple domains. It is capable to use the neural network model to predict the samples with triggers as target labels in the inference stage through adding the samples with triggers to the data set and changing the labels of samples to target labels in the training process of supervised learning. Backdoor attacks have threaten the interests of model owners severely, especially in high value-added areas like financial security. To preserve backdoor attacks-derived neural network model, a series of defense strategies are implemented. However, conventional defense methods are often required for the prior knowledge of backdoor attack methods or neural network models in relevant to the type and size of the trigger, which is inconsistent and limits the application scenarios of defense methods. To resolve this problem, we develop a backdoor defense method based on input-modified image classification task, called information purification network (IPN). The process of the IPNcan eliminates the impact of the trigger-added samples. Method To alleviate a large amount of redundant information in image samples, we segment the image information into two categories: 1) classification task-oriented semantic information, and 2) classification task-inrelevant non-semantic information. To get the sample being predicted as the target label for interpretation, backdoor attack can enforce the model to pay attention to the non-semantic information of the sample during the model training process. To suppress the noise of trigger, our IPN is demonstrated as a CNN used for encoding and decoding the input samples, which aims to keep the image semantics unchanged via minimizing the non-semantic information in the original samples. The inputs to the IPN are as the clean samples, as well as the outputs are as the modified samples. For specific training, first, several clean classifiers are trained on the basis of multiple structures and training hyperparameters. Then, the IPN is optimized to make the difference between the modified sample and the original sample as large as possible on the premise of keeping the modified sample correctly predicted by the above classifier. The loss function consists of two aspects as mentioned below: 1) semantic information retention, and 2) non-semantic information suppression. To alleviate the difference between the sample and the original sample, the weight of the two parts of the loss function can be balanced. The process of IPN-related sample decoding can disrupt the structure of the trigger. Therefore, the sample will not be predicted as the target label even if the model is injected backdoor. In addition, due to the semantic information in the samples image is not weakened, trigger-involved samples can be used to predict the correct labels whether the model is injected into the backdoor or not. Result All experiments are performed on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card. The execution environment is Python 3. 8. 5 with Pytorch version 1. 9. 1. The datasets are tested in relevant to CIFAR10, MNIST, and Image-Net10. The ImageNet10 dataset is constructed in terms of selecting 10 categories from the Image Net dataset in random, which are composed of 12831 images in total. We randomly selected 10 264 images as the training dataset, and the remaining 2567 images as the test dataset. The architecture of the IPN is U-Net. To evaluate the defense performance of the proposed strategy in detail, a variety of different triggers are used to implement backdoor attacks. For MNIST datasets, the classification accuracy of the clean model for the initial clean sample is 99% . We use two different triggers to implement backdoor attacks as well. Each average classification accuracy of clean samples is 99%, and the success rates of backdoor attacks are 100% . After all samples are encoded and decoded by the IPN, the classification accuracy of clean samples is remained in consistent, while the success rate of backdoor attacks dropped to 10%, and the backdoor samples are predicted to be correctly labeled 98% as well. The experimental results are similar to MNIST for the other two datasets. While the classification accuracy of clean samples decreases slightly, the success rate of backdoor attacks is optimized about 10%, and the backdoor samples are correctly predicted with high accuracy. It should be mentioned that the intensity and size of the triggers can impact the defensive performance of the proposed strategy to a certain extent. The weight between the two parts of the loss function will affect the accuracy of clean samples. The weight of non-semantic information suppression loss is positive correlated to the difference of images and negative correlated to the classification accuracy of clean samples. Conclusion Our proposed strategy is not required any prior knowledge for triggers and the models to be protected. The classification accuracy of clean samples can keep unchanged, and the success rate of backdoor attack is equivalent to random guess, and the backdoor samples will be predicted as correct labels by classifiers, regardless of the problem of classifiers are injected into the backdoor. The training of the IPN is required on clean training data and the task of the protected model only. In the implementation of defense, the IPN can just be configured to predominate the protected model for input sample preprocessing. Multiple backdoor attacks are simulated on the three mentioned data sets.

As with other ML applications, these solutions rely on model selection, which is typically achieved by evaluating certain metrics on models separately and selecting the model whose evaluations (i.e., accuracy-related loss and/or certain interpretability measures) are optimal. However, empirical evidence suggests that, in practice, multiple models often attain competitive results. Therefore, while models' overall performance could be similar, they could operate quite differently. This results in an implicit tradeoff in models' performance throughout the feature space which resolving requires new model selection tools. This paper explores methods for comparing predictive models in an interpretable manner to uncover the tradeoff and help resolve it. To this end, we propose various methods that synthesize ideas from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and visualization to demonstrate how they can be used to inform model developers about the model selection process.

Assuming such a process for the short-rate gives rise to an affine term structure model for which we can now provide the bond price formulas that had so far not been accessible by attempting to solve the usual Riccati equation. By conditioning the exponentiated time integral on the potential states of the integrated process at its endpoint, we obtain the building blocks to evaluate certain interest rate derivatives, namely Bermudan swaptions. This is achieved by an algorithm that determines the exercise decision at each state by comparing the available payoff with an explicit lower bound built from such conditional Laplace transforms, without resorting to estimation techniques such as American Monte Carlo.",Bermudan swaptions | Bessel processes | Interest rate models | Laplace transforms | Stochastic processes,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

As a financial model based on Internet technology, compared with traditional bank loans, online loans have lower operating costs and faster returns, so they are developing rapidly. Providing users with better and faster services while standardizing operations has always been the development goal of various Internet finance companies. At present, many domestic Internet financial enterprises are facing many problems such as difficulty in risk control. Therefore, this paper makes full use of deep learning algorithms to build an Internet financial risk control system. After in-depth analysis and research on the deep learning algorithm, the Internet financial risk control system is divided into several modules. The project mainly includes model management module, user behavior analysis module, alarm management module, monitoring module, product management module, etc., and then by analyzing the test results of each test scenario, it is concluded that the performance test of the system design meets the actual needs of users, and simulates the test. It is carried out in accordance with the constraints and regulations of the test plan, and the performance test meets the standard. The system not only ensures the safety of the company's funds, but also helps the company to form a smooth and effective financial risk control process.

Making the most of inventory planning, machine learning (ML) maximizes the movement of commodities from one site to another. By facilitating waste reduction and quality improvement across numerous components, it reduces operational expenses. The focus of this study was to analyze existing dairy supply chain (DSC) optimization strategies and to look for ways in which DSC could be further improved. This study tends to enhance the operational excellence and continuous improvements of optimization strategies for DSC management Design/methodology/approach: Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards for systematic reviews are served as inspiration for the study's methodology. The accepted protocol for reporting evidence in systematic reviews and meta-analyses is PRISMA. Health sciences associations and publications support the standards. For this study, the authors relied on descriptive statistics. Findings: As a result of this modernization initiative, dairy sector has been able to boost operational efficiency by using cutting-edge optimization strategies. Historically, DSC researchers have relied on mathematical modeling tools, but recently authors have started using artificial intelligence (AI) and ML-based approaches. While mathematical modeling-based methods are still most often used, AI/ML-based methods are quickly becoming the preferred method. During the transit phase, cloud computing, shared databases and software actually transmit data to distributors, logistics companies and retailers. The company has developed comprehensive deployment, distribution and storage space selection methods as well as a supply chain road map. Practical implications: Many sorts of environmental degradation, including large emissions of greenhouse gases that fuel climate change, are caused by the dairy industry. The industry not only harms the environment, but it also causes a great deal of animal suffering. Smaller farms struggle to make milk at the low prices that large farms, which are frequently supported by subsidies and other financial incentives, set. Originality/value: This paper addresses a need in the dairy business by giving a primer on optimization methods and outlining how farmers and distributors may increase the efficiency of dairy processing facilities.

For this problem, we focus on the client selection with federated learning, which can affect the convergence performance of the global model with the selected local models. We propose FedChoice, a client selection method based on loss function optimization, to select appropriate local models to improve the convergence of the global model. It firstly sets selected probability for clients with the value of loss function, and the client with high loss will be set higher selected probability, which can make them more likely to participate in training. Then, it introduces a local control vector and a global control vector to predict the local gradient direction and global gradient direction, respectively, and calculates the gradient correction vector to correct the gradient direction to reduce the cumulative deviation of the local gradient caused by the Non-IID data. We make experiments to verify the validity of FedChoice on CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, MNIST, EMNITS, and FEMNIST datasets, and the results show that the convergence of FedChoice is significantly improved, compared with FedAvg, FedProx, and FedNova.",Federated learning | model aggregation | Non-IID,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,NSFC,2021C03187,National Natural Science Foundation of China

However, many accounting systems are yet to catch up with current technological developments. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) in financial accounting is often applied only in pilot projects. Using AI-based forecasts in accounting enables proactive management and detailed analysis. However, thus far, there is little knowledge about which prediction models have already been evaluated for accounting problems. Given this lack of research, our study aims to summarize existing findings on how AI is used for forecasting purposes in financial accounting. Therefore, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview and agenda for future researchers to gain more generalizable knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify existing research on AI-based forecasting in financial accounting by conducting a systematic literature review. For this purpose, the authors used Scopus and Web of Science as scientific databases. The data collection resulted in a final sample size of 47 studies. These studies were analyzed regarding their forecasting purpose, sample size, period and applied machine learning algorithms. Findings: The authors identified three application areas and presented details regarding the accuracy and AI methods used. Our findings show that sociotechnical and generalizable knowledge is still missing. Therefore, the authors also develop an open research agenda that future researchers can address to enable the more frequent and efficient use of AI-based forecasts in financial accounting. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the rapid development of AI algorithms, our results can only provide an overview of the current state of research. Therefore, it is likely that new AI algorithms will be applied, which have not yet been covered in existing research. However, interested researchers can use our findings and future research agenda to develop this field further. Practical implications: Given the high relevance of AI in financial accounting, our results have several implications and potential benefits for practitioners. First, the authors provide an overview of AI algorithms used in different accounting use cases. Based on this overview, companies can evaluate the AI algorithms that are most suitable for their practical needs. Second, practitioners can use our results as a benchmark of what prediction accuracy is achievable and should strive for. Finally, our study identified several blind spots in the research, such as ensuring employee acceptance of machine learning algorithms in companies. However, companies should consider this to implement AI in financial accounting successfully. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted that provided a comprehensive overview of AI-based forecasting in financial accounting. Given the high potential of AI in accounting, the authors aimed to bridge this research gap.

The key reason for the decline of the theatrical sector is that OTT platforms are giving quality content at a very low price. Before the introduction of OTT, platform theaters were overpricing the tickets which led to loss of interest from the consumer side. To solve this problem, in this work, a system was developed that can assist both providers and consumers by bringing competition within the virtual entertainment media market. The ability to purchase film tickets at a wider range of prices is enabled by dynamic ticket pricing. This is dependent on several parameters such as the movie's life cycle, the time of day, the day of the week, the title of the picture, the venue, the screen size, and others.

For modeling the asynchronous event sequence, neural point process is one of the most mainstream solutions. With the more and more in-depth study of neural point process, in order to boost the prediction accuracy of the model, the complexity of the model cannot be overestimated, or the selected model itself has more nonlinearity. For example, the neural point process based on attention mechanism will lead to great complexity of the model. Meanwhile, with the development of deep learning, people find that the traditional multi-layer perceptron has great potential. Now many model architectures built with pure multi-layer perceptron without attention have been proposed, and the effect is better than the attention mechanism. Therefore, the multi-layer perceptron has been ""reborn"" and has attracted extensive attention. Inspired by this, we propose the Linear Normalization Attention Hawkes Process (LNAHP), which substitutes the multi-head dot-product attention from the transformer for linear normalization attention, and learns the hidden representation through two linear transformation layers and normalization operation, which markedly reduces the complexity of the model. The performance for different evaluation metrics for the LNAHP is verified and compared to the current baselines on real datasets from different fields and synthetic datasets, which proves the effectiveness of the LNAHP.",Asynchronous event sequence | Hawkes process | Linear normalization attention | Neural Hawkes process,0,0,,,,undefined,

The ability to predict the likelihood of backorders can surely minimise a company's losses. Because the number of backorders is much lower than the number of orders that ship on time, applying a predictive model for this domain is a challenging task. This paper proposes a model that uses a deep neural network to predict backorders; it handles the data imbalance between backorders and filled orders with efficient techniques. To make the dataset balanced, we employ different techniques that include minority class weight boosting, randomised oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, and a combination of oversampling and undersampling. The balanced training data are used in our proposed, fully connected deep neural networks model to train the predictive model. The predictive model learns the likelihood of product backorders by using the training samples. We conduct experiments on a large benchmark dataset to test the performance of our proposed deep neural network–based model. The experimental results achieve a new state-of-the-art performance and outperform some prominent classification models in terms of standard evaluation metrics and expected profit measure.",deep neural network | imbalanced data | prediction | Product backorder | synthetic oversampling,15,0,,,,19-15498S,

To remedy this, we develop a novel regulatory scoring framework to quantify and compare the corresponding regulatory capital charge errors of credit scoring models. As an application of RegTech, the proposed framework considers the characteristic of example-dependence and cost-sensitivity in credit scoring, which is expected to enhance the ability of risk absorption of financial institutions and thus benefit the regulators. Validated on two real-world credit datasets, empirical results reveal that credit scoring models with good predictive accuracy or profitability do not necessarily provide low capital charge requirement error, which further highlights the importance of regulatory scoring framework. The family of gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) provides significantly better average performance than industry benchmarks and deep multilayer percep-tron network, especially when financial stability is the primary focus. To further examine the robustness of the proposed regulatory scoring, sampling techniques, cut-off value modification, and probability calibration are employed within the framework and the main conclusions hold in most cases. Furthermore, the analysis on the interpretability via TreeSHAP algorithm alleviates the concerns on transparency of GBDT-based models, and confirms the important roles of loan characteristics, borrowers’ solvency and creditworthiness as powerful predictors in credit scoring.

The default for an individual loan occurs when the assets of a company (or individual) fall below a certain threshold. These assets are typically modeled according to a factor model, thereby introducing a strong dependence both among the individual loans, and potentially also among the multivariate vector of common factors. In this paper, we derive sharp tail asymptotics under two regimes: (i) a large loss regime, where the total number of defaults increases asymptotically to infinity; and (ii) a small default regime, where the loss threshold for an individual loan is allowed to tend asymptotically to negative infinity. Extending beyond the well-studied Gaussian distributional assumptions, we establish that—while the thresholds in the large loss regime are characterized by idiosyncratic factors specific to the individual loans—the rate of decay is governed by the common factors. Conversely, in the small default regime, we establish that the tail of the loss distribution is governed by systemic factors. We also discuss estimates for Value-at-Risk, and observe that our results may be extended to cases where the number of factors diverges to infinity.",Expected Shortfall | large deviations | model uncertainty | multiple types | risk management | tail approximations | Value-at-Risk,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Building on the foundations provided by the extant literature, this study aims to design an agent-based market model capable of reproducing the behavior of the Bitcoin market during the time of an alleged Bitcoin price manipulation that occurred between 2017 and early 2018.

Several price dips and volume anomalies are explained by the actions of the fraudulent trader, completing the known body of evidence extracted from blockchain activity. The model suggests that the presence of the fraudulent agent was essential to obtain Bitcoin price development in the given time period; without this agent, it would have been very unlikely that the price had reached the heights as it did in late 2017.

The present paper explores two ways of selecting the states of a discrete-time Markov model for a system partitioned into categories where the duration of stay in a category affects the probability of transition to another category. For a set of panel data, we compare the likelihood fits of the Markov models with states based on duration intervals and with states defined by duration values. For hierarchical systems, we show that the model with states based on duration values has a better maximum likelihood fit than the baseline Markov model where the states are the categories.

However, the pricing model discussed in those papers is too simple for practical purposes. It motivates us to consider how to implement more complex models used in financial institutions. In this paper, we consider the local volatility (LV) model, in which the volatility of the underlying asset price depends on the price and time. As in previous studies, we use the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) as the main source of quantum speedup and discuss the state preparation step of the QAE, or equivalently, the implementation of the asset price evolution. We compare two types of state preparation: One is the amplitude encoding (AE) type, where the probability distribution of the derivative’s payoff is encoded to the probabilistic amplitude. The other is the pseudo-random number (PRN) type, where sequences of PRNs are used to simulate the asset price evolution as in classical Monte Carlo simulation. We present detailed circuit diagrams for implementing these preparation methods in fault-tolerant quantum computation and roughly estimate required resources such as the number of qubits and T-count.",Finance | Pricing | Quantum computing,7,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Medicine has adopted IoT, ML, and deep learning (DL); hence, automated machines could build medical records, diagnose diseases, and, overmuch significantly, carry on timely observing patients. ML and DL algorithms act diversely on various datasets. Since the predictive outcomes differ, this could affect the general outcomes. The difference in forecasting outcomes seems significant in the clinical decision-making procedure. Thus, it is all-important to realize the variant ML and DL algorithms applied to deal with IoT data in medicine. This chapter spotlights known ML and DL algorithms for classification and forecasting and presents their applications in medicine. The aim of this chapter is to show a broad summary of current ML and DL techniques and their application in IoT biomedical data. In a careful investigation, we find that diverse ML and DL forecasting algorithms have different defects.

Considering the rich semantic inference of negative edges, excluding them as an obvious solution is not elegant. Alternatively, another basic approach is to apply positive normalization, however, this also may lead to information loss. Our work proposes a simple yet effective solution to overcome these two challenges by employing the eigenvectors with top-k largest eigenvalues of the raw adjacency matrix for pre-embeddings. These pre-embeddings contain high-order topological knowledge together with the information on negative edges, which are then fed into a GNN with a positively normalized adjacency matrix to compensate for its shortcomings.

However, it has become an important issue for financial institutions to effectively assess the credit risk in the process of online supply chain financing. In this paper, an online supply chain risk assessment method, which is based on a hybrid model chain, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique for Nominal and Continuous (SMOTENC), and Random Forest (RF), is proposed to identify and control the credit risk of financial institutions.

On the basis of the system, the best index number of the assessment system and the minority samples are obtained by the XGBoost algorithm and the SMOTENC algorithm, respectively.

Emerging blockchain technology can help improve credit-reporting ability through greater integrity, decentralization, transparency, security, and reliability. Aiming to address the problem of extensive credit investigation data and privacy protection, we propose a blockchain-based model to realize access control and management of the shared transaction information in the supply chain. Our model adopts a consensus mechanism to solve the problem of large credit investigation data and privacy protection of credit investigation data and realizes access control and management of the shared data chain. In our model, data are stored on the cloud server and shared with the proxy reencryption method. The model's data structure and workflow are designed to facilitate specific applications in supply chain finance. The embedded blockchain technology helps build the open shared reference architecture and establish the entire life cycle of a monitoring mechanism. The existing blockchain consensus mechanism has low security and a large resource consumption; as such, it is particularly important to design a new consensus mechanism to serve the credit investigation system. In this study, blockchain data sharing and traceability can be realized by improving the consensus mechanism, helping to improve the existing credit investigation service system.

It is imperative that the reasons for pedestrian injuries be identified if we are to improve the safety of this group of road users who are particularly susceptible. These results were obtained mostly through the use of well-established statistical approaches. A lack of flexibility in managing outliers, incomplete, or inconsistent data, as well as rigid pre-assumptions, have been criticized in these models. This study employed three well-known machine learning models to predict road-crash-related pedestrian fatalities (RCPF). These models included support vector machines (SVM), ensemble decision trees (EDT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). These models were hybridized with a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to find the optimum values of their hyperparameters, which are extremely important to accurately predict the RCPF. The findings of this study show that all the three models’ performance was improved using the BO. The KNN model had the highest improvement in accuracy (+11%) after the BO was applied to it. However, the ultimate accuracy of the SVM and EDT models was higher than that of the KNN model.

Furthermore, by using the idea of l1 penalty function and a smooth approximation technique, the resulting deterministic DOP becomes a smoothing penalty problem, which is a non-convex nonlinear parameter optimization problem (NNPOP) with simple bounds on the variables. To solve the NNPOP, a gradient-based stochastic search algorithm (GSSA) is developed based on a gradient-based adaptive search algorithm (GASA) and a novel stochastic search algorithm (NSSA). The convergence analysis result shows that the GSSA is a globally convergent algorithm. Finally, two numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The main distinctive aspect of the mixture is that despite the underlying processes have the Markov property, the mixture itself in general does not. Conditional transition matrix and the joint probability distribution of the first-exit times form non-stationary functions of time with ability to capture path dependence when conditioning on available information (either full or partial) of the sample path. In particular, initial profile of the joint distribution forms a generalized mixture of the multivariate phase-type distributions of Assaf et al. (1984). When the underlying Markov processes have the same intensity matrix, in which case the mixture becomes a simple Markov jump process, the path dependence and non-stationary properties are removed from the transition matrix and the joint distribution, while the initial profile distribution reduces to Assaf et al.

The inventory of models for the case when both the outcome and predictor variables are compositional is limited, and the existing models are often difficult to interpret in the compositional space, due to their use of complex log-ratio transformations. We develop a transformation-free linear regression model where the expected value of the compositional outcome is expressed as a single Markov transition from the compositional predictor. Our approach is based on estimating equations thereby not requiring complete specification of data likelihood and is robust to different data-generating mechanisms. Our model is simple to interpret, allows for 0s and 1s in both the compositional outcome and covariates, and subsumes several interesting subcases of interest. We also develop permutation tests for linear independence and equality of effect sizes of two components of the predictor. Finally, we show that despite its simplicity, our model accurately captures the relationship between compositional data using two datasets from education and medical research.",compositional data | estimating equation | expectation-maximization algorithm | Kullback–Leibler distance loss function | transformation-free,7,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Simply designing the static reward function for deep reinforcement learning may be difficult to guide an agent to adapt to the change of the customer credit scoring environment. To solve this problem, we propose the deep Q-network with the confusion-matrix-based dynamic reward function (DQN-CMDRF) model. Especially, the new constructed dynamic reward function can adjust the reward dynamically according to the change of confusion matrix after each deep Q-network model training, which can guide the agent to adapt to the change of environment quickly, so as to improve the customer credit scoring performance of the deep Q-network model. First, we formulate customer credit scoring as a finite Markov decision process. Second, to adjust the reward dynamically according to the customer credit scoring environment, the dynamic reward function is designed based on the confusion matrix. Finally, we introduce the confusion-matrix-based dynamic reward function into the deep Q-network model for customer credit scoring. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we introduce four evaluation measures and make a series of experiments on the five customer credit scoring datasets. The experimental results show that the constructed dynamic reward function can more effectively improve customer credit scoring performance of the deep Q-network model, and the performance of the DQN-CMDRF model is significantly better than that of the other eight traditional classification models. More importantly, we find that the constructed dynamic reward function can accelerate the convergence speed and improve the stability of the deep Q-network model.",Confusion matrix | Customer credit scoring | Deep Q-network | Deep reinforcement learning | Dynamic reward function,15,0,,,NSFC,PXM2021-178216-000002,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Being able to predict rating changes will greatly benefit both investors and regulators alike. In this paper, we consider the corporate credit rating migration early prediction problem, which predicts the credit rating of an issuer will be upgraded, unchanged, or downgraded after 12 months based on its latest financial reporting information at the time. We investigate the effectiveness of different standard machine learning algorithms and conclude these models deliver inferior performance. As part of our contribution, we propose a new Multi-task Envisioning Transformer-based Autoencoder (META) model to tackle this challenging problem. META consists of Positional Encoding, Transformer-based Autoencoder, and Multi-task Prediction to learn effective representations for both migration prediction and rating prediction.

Actually, when choosing loans, most lenders pursue the highest profit with the lowest risk as well as satisfying their hobbies. In this article, we formalize a multi-objective optimization problem to help lenders select loan portfolios. Specifically, the recommending scenario in P2P lending is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, where two objective functions are designed for capturing lenders' multiple demands. On this basis, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on return-risk management named MOEA-RRM is then proposed for the multi-objective optimization problem, which can help lenders choose loan portfolios to meet lenders' multiple demands. Furthermore, in MOEA-RRM, a decision space dimensionality reduction strategy and an initialization strategy are proposed to improve the performance of algorithm. Finally, experimental results on a real-world P2P lending data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MOEA-RRM, i.e., the proposed approach can recommend the loan portfolio with a good trade-off between risk and return as well as satisfying the hobbies of lenders.",Loan portfolio | Multi-objective optimization | P2P lending | Personalized recommendation,5,0,,,NSFC,61876184,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Algorithmic Recourses (ARs) provide “what if” feedback of the form “if an input datapoint were x0 instead of x, then an ML-based system’s output would be y0 instead of y.” ARs are attractive due to their actionable feedback, amenability to existing legal frameworks, and fidelity to the underlying ML model. Yet, current AR approaches are single shot—that is, they assume x can change to x0 in a single time period. We propose a novel stochastic-control-based approach that generates sequential ARs, that is, ARs that allow x to move stochastically and sequentially across intermediate states to a final state x0. Our approach is model agnostic and black box. Furthermore, the calculation of ARs is amortized such that once trained, it applies to multiple datapoints without the need for re-optimization. In addition to these primary characteristics, our approach admits optional desiderata such as adherence to the data manifold, respect for causal relations, and sparsity—identified by past research as desirable properties of ARs.

Model explainability and interpretability present challenges from a regulatory perspective which demands transparency for acceptance; they also offer the opportunity for improved insight into and understanding of customers. Post-hoc approaches are typically used for explaining pretrained reinforcement learning models. Based on our previous modeling of customer spending behaviour, we adapt our recent reinforcement learning algorithm that intrinsically characterizes desirable behaviours and we transition to the problem of prosperity management. We train inherently interpretable reinforcement learning agents to give investment advice that is aligned with prototype financial personality traits which are combined to make a final recommendation.

One problem that needs to be addressed urgently is that of how to raise the proper funds for highway maintenance to ensure the sustainable operation of the project. To this end, the aim of this study is to investigate the capital demand for operation and maintenance of a project by means of a refinancing scheme, in order to reduce the possibility of project bankruptcy and to enhance the economic value of the project. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an analysis of the dynamic complexity of the highway pavement maintenance system, a Markov model is used to predict pavement performance, and an optimal capital structure decision model is proposed for highway public–private partnership (PPP) project refinancing, using the method of system dynamics (SD). The proposed model is then applied to a real case study. Findings: Results show that the proposed model can be used to predict accurately the dynamic changes in the demand for road maintenance funds and refinancing during the period of operation, before making the optimal decision for the refinancing capital structure. Originality/value: Although many scholars have studied the optimal refinancing capital structure of PPP projects, the dynamic changes inherent in the demand for maintenance funds for highway PPP projects are seldom considered. Therefore, in the approach used here the influence of the dynamic change of road maintenance capital demand on refinancing is investigated, and SD is used for the optimal capital structure decision-making model of highway PPP project refinancing, to make the decision-making process more reasonable and scientific.",Highway pavement performance | Highway PPP project | Markov model | Refinancing capital structure | System dynamics,2,0,,,,undefined,

As a result, the growth of fossil-fuel electricity generators reduces renewable electricity competitiveness and slows its development. Since renewable electricity has an insufficient market share (less than 5% of total electricity generation in these countries, according to global statistics), its development should become a priority due to fossil-fuel depletion and demand growth in the future. The present study investigates various scenarios to examine the energy sector's development in countries facing severe competitiveness challenges of renewable electricity. Then, it recommends the most appropriate policies through evaluating the proposed plans' effectiveness. In this regard, a comprehensive framework has been developed by integrating system dynamics modeling, agent-based modeling logic, and game theory concepts. This systemic modeling procedure has several advantages, including formation of a macro policymaking perspective, the analysis of renewable electricity development trends, and the simulation of competitors' and investors' reactions and decisions. In this case, Iran is chosen for the study due to being a representative of these countries, and its data have been used to validate the proposed model. Model validation showed less than 9% error between simulation results and real data. Besides, the simulation results indicated that establishing a competitive market and enacting targeted support policies could stimulate the development of renewable electricity up to the year 2060. A presumed combined policy based on efficient simulated scenarios could increase renewable electricity capacity and market share 5-fold and 6-fold by 2035, respectively.

The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customer's sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens up the door of privacy leakage. A recently invented privacy-preserving distributed ML scheme referred to as Federated learning (FL) enables generating a target model without sharing local information through on-device model training on edge resources. In this paper, we propose an FL-based application to predict customers’ financial issues by constructing a global learning model that is evolved based on the local models of the distributed agents. The local models are generated by the network agents using their on-device data and local resources. We used the FL concept because the learning strategy does not require sharing any data with the server or any other agent that ensures the preservation of customers’ sensitive data. To that end, we enable partial works from the weak agents that eliminate the issue if the model convergence is retarded due to straggler agents. We also leverage asynchronous FL that cut off the extra waiting time during global model generation. We simulated the performance of our FL model considering a popular dataset, Give me Some Credit (Freshcorn, 2017). We evaluated our proposed method considering a a different number of stragglers and setting up various computational tasks (e.g., local epoch, batch size), and simulated the training loss and testing accuracy of the prediction model. Finally, we compared the F1-score of our proposed model with the existing centralized and decentralized approaches. Our results show that our proposed model achieves an almost identical F1-score as like centralized model even when we set up a skew-level of more than 80% and outperforms the state-of-the-art FL models by obtaining an average of 5∼6% higher accuracy when we have resource-constrained agents within a learning environment.",Federated learning | Financial distress | Global model | Local model | Model aggregation | On-device training,10,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,FIU,undefined,Florida International University

In the framework, the prediction model is used to predict future trading price trend, and the trading policy is used to determine the price and number of orders. Even though, the shortcomings of machine learning models are obvious, mainly are, (1) Slow prediction speed. Huge human-craft features and model computing cost much time, which is ten times of pure trading policy without model. (2) Poor generalization. This kind of models can hardly adapt to market data in each period, because market traders will change time to time at micro level, thus the distribution of market data will change. But current model is trained on a long period dataset, it achieves best effect at average, but can not adapt to different market at each period. To address this problem, we propose a novel online model optimization algorithm. A light model library will be constructed. Each light model in this library corresponds to a different market distribution. By devising the appropriate reward function via inverse reinforcement learning algorithm, the algorithm can accurately estimate the profits of each model. Then the model can be selected automatically in real-time trading, so that the trading policies can automatically adapt to changes in trading market, overcoming previous shortcoming of manually updating model and slow prediction speed.

This paper attempts to resolve this label-imbalance problem for GNNs by maximizing the AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) metric since it is unbiased with label distribution. However, maximizing AUC on GNN for fraud detection tasks is intractable due to the potential polluted topological structure caused by intentional noisy edges generated by fraudsters. To alleviate this problem, we propose to decouple the AUC maximization process on GNN into a classifier parameter searching and an edge pruning policy searching, respectively. We propose a model named AO-GNN (Short for AUC-oriented GNN), to achieve AUC maximization on GNN under the aforementioned framework. In the proposed model, an AUC-oriented stochastic gradient is applied for classifier parameter searching, and an AUC-oriented reinforcement learning module supervised by a surrogate reward of AUC is devised for edge pruning policy searching.

The dynamics of the jump processes cause the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equations to have an intricate state-dependence, which makes the design of efficient algorithms difficult.

Two models are developed: the first provides the probability of a missed payment during the next month for each customer, which is described as Missed payment prediction Long Short Term Memory model (MP-LSTM), whilst the second estimates the total monthly amount of purchases, which is defined as Purchase Estimation Prediction Long Short Term Memory model (PE-LSTM). Based on both models, a customer behavioural grouping is provided, which can be helpful for the bank’s decision-making. Both models are trained on real credit card transactional datasets. Customer behavioural scores are analysed using classical performance evaluation measures. Calibration analysis of MP-LSTM scores showed that they could be considered as probabilities of missed payments. Obtained purchase estimations were analysed using mean square error and absolute error. The MP-LSTM model was compared to four traditional well-known machine learning algorithms.

The unstructured P2P network is the most popular topology, and the resources are fully distributed among participating peers. Therefore, searching is a challenging issue due to the absence of control over resource locations. Intelligent decisions should be made to select a particular number of neighbors that can hold relevant resources for queries instead of selecting neighbors randomly. In this paper, an intelligent neighbor selection (INS) algorithm is introduced that uses a reinforcement learning approach, ‘Q-learning’. The main objective of this algorithm is to achieve better retrieval effectiveness with reduced searching costs by fewer connected peers, exchanged messages, and less time. To achieve this, INS relies on Q-learning, which makes a Q-table in each peer and stores the Q-values gathered from the results of previously sent queries, and uses them for the forthcoming queries. The cold start issue during the training phase is also addressed in this research, which allows INS to improve its results continuously. The simulation results show a significant improvement in searching for a resource with compression to controlled flooding and learning processes after sufficient training.

The geographic distance between natural gas resources and load centers calls for a holistic tool for joint expansion of power systems and natural gas networks. In this paper, a Dynamic Stochastic Joint Expansion Planning (DSJEP) of power systems and natural gas networks is proposed to minimize the investment and operational costs of power and natural gas systems. Electrical and natural gas storage (ENGS) are considered as an option for decision-makers in the DSJEP problem. The proposed approach takes into account long-term uncertainties in natural gas prices and electric and natural gas demands through scenario realizations. In dynamic planning, more scenario needs more time for computation; therefore, scenario reduction is implemented to eschew unnecessary scenarios. The proposed formulation is implemented on a four-bus electricity system with a five-node natural gas network. To demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach, it is also tested on the IEEE 118-bus system with a 14-node natural gas network. The numerical results demonstrate that ENGS can reduce the total investment cost, up to 52% in the test cases, and operational cost, up to 3%.

Secondly, we extend the approach of Pelsser and Ghalehjooghi to credit insurance in this framework. Starting from classical time-inconsistent actuarial pricing methods, we derive partial integro-differential equations (PIDE) for their time-consistent counterparts. We discuss numerical methods for solving these PIDEs and their results. We draw two conclusions from these results. On the one hand, we show that time-consistent evaluations tend to give higher prices, compared to time-inconsistent evaluations. On the other hand, our results show that the time-consistency of evaluations allows to better take into account the risk of contagion in credit insurance, if such a risk exists.

A realistic assessment of digital algorithms, though, must acknowledge that government is already driven by algorithms of arguably greater complexity and potential for abuse: the algorithms implicit in human decision-making. The human brain operates algorithmically through complex neural networks. And when humans make collective decisions, they operate via algorithms too—those reflected in legislative, judicial, and administrative processes. Yet these human algorithms undeniably fail and are far from transparent. On an individual level, human decision-making suffers from memory limitations, fatigue, cognitive biases, and racial prejudices, among other problems. On an organizational level, humans succumb to groupthink and free riding, along with other collective dysfunctionalities. As a result, human decisions will in some cases prove far more problematic than their digital counterparts. Digital algorithms, such as machine learning, can improve governmental performance by facilitating outcomes that are more accurate, timely, and consistent. Still, when deciding whether to deploy digital algorithms to perform tasks currently completed by humans, public officials should proceed with care on a case-by-case basis. They should consider both whether a particular use would satisfy the basic preconditions for successful machine learning and whether it would in fact lead to demonstrable improvements over the status quo. The question about the future of public administration is not whether digital algorithms are perfect.

The issue is that human biases towards certain groups of population, defined by sensitive features like race and gender, are introduced to the training data through data collection and labeling. Two important directions of fairness ensuring research have focused on (i) instance weighting in order to decrease the impact of more biased instances and (ii) adversarial training in order to construct data representations informative of the target variable, but uninformative of the sensitive attributes. In this paper we propose a Fair Adversarial Instance Re-weighting (FAIR) method, which uses adversarial training to learn instance weighting function that ensures fair predictions. Merging the two paradigms, it inherits desirable properties from both interpretability of reweighting and end-to-end trainability of adversarial training. We propose four different variants of the method and, among other things, demonstrate how the method can be cast in a fully probabilistic framework.

We compare FAIR models to ten other related and state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that FAIR is able to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and unfairness.

GBDTs, a group of boosting-type ensemble algorithms, have shown promising improvement for credit scoring. However, GBDT improves the credit scoring performance by iteratively modifying only the fitting target for each base classifier and invariably works on the same features, which limits the diversity of individual classifiers in GBDT; Moreover, the performance-interpretability dilemma motivated a large number of works to focus on the pursuit of high-performance ensemble strategies, which leads to the lack of explorations on the interpretability of the credit scoring models. Based on the above limitations, two tree-based augmented GBDTs (AugBoost-RFS and AugBoost-RFU) are proposed in this work for credit scoring. In the proposed methods, a step-wise feature augmentation mechanism is introduced for GBDT to enrich the diversity of individual base classifiers; Tree-based embedding technologies simplify the process of feature augmentation and inherit interpretability of GBDT. Results on 4 large-scale credit scoring datasets show AugBoost-RFS/AugBoost-RFU outperforms GBDT; Besides, supervised tree-based step-wise feature augmentation for GBDT achieves comparable results to neural network-based step-wise feature augmentation while significantly improve the augmentation efficiency. Moreover, the intrinsic global interpreted results and decision rules of tree-enhanced GBDTs, as well as the marginal contributions of features that are visualized by TreeSHAP demonstrate AugBoost-RFS/AugBoost-RFU can be good candidates for interpretable credit scoring.",Credit scoring | Feature augmentation | Gradient boosting decision trees | Interpretability,35,0,,,NSFC,19ZR1402100,Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai

For some Markov chains, it is infeasible to obtain the explicit expressions of their corresponding finite-dimensional distributions and sometimes it is time-consuming for computation. In this paper, we propose an approximation method for Markov chains by applying the copula theory. For this purpose, we first discuss the checkerboard copula-based Markov chain, which is the Markov chain generated by the family of checkerboard copulas. This Markov chain has some appealing properties, such as self-similarity in copulas and having explicit forms of finite-dimensional distributions. Then we prove that each Markov chain can be approximated by a sequence of checkerboard copula-based Markov chains, and the error bounds of the approximate distributions are provided. Employing the checkerboard copula-based approximation method, we propose a sufficient condition for the geometric β-mixing of copula-based Markov chains. This condition allows copulas of Markov chains to be asymmetric. Finally, by applying the approximation method, analytical recurrence formulas are also derived for computing approximate distributions of both the first passage time and the occupation time of a Markov chain, and numerical results are listed to show the approximation errors.",91G60 | checkerboard copula-based Markov chain | copula | Markov chain | β-mixing property | ∂-convergence,1,0,,,NSFC,11561047,National Natural Science Foundation of China

We presented a probabilistic decision function taking into account the posterior probability of each base RVM model dividing the sample into each category. The RVM with high sparsity is used as the base component to obtain the good balance between the accuracy, robustness and resource consumption, which can sacrifice less time and storage cost in ensemble incremental learning while achieving higher detection accuracy and stability in network data streams.",data stream | Ensemble methods | incremental learning | intrusion detection | RVM,8,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

Over the years, a diverse range of solution methodologies have been developed for solving this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of latest maintenance strategy paradigms and solution approaches proposed for the selection of an appropriate strategy in various industries. It would provide a systematic mapping of developments in this field and identify some research gaps to explore further studies. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic state-of-the-art comprehensive literature review on maintenance strategy paradigms and selection approaches is presented in this study. In this study, 87 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals, since year 2012, are reviewed. Findings: For the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy, a variety of criteria are considered to better evaluate the alternatives. In this study, contemporary strategies are discussed, and their applications in different industries are also depicted. Moreover, through the analysis of extant literature, critical criteria are selected and classified in six major categories (namely, economic, technical, safety, environmental, feasibility and social) and further sub-categorized in quantitative and qualitative classes. These clusters of criteria can be helpful as an initial set of criteria for survey and then case- or industry-specific criteria can be shortlisted for further alternative evaluation. Practical implications: From the perspective of maintenance managers, maintenance management can be a very difficult task, considering the numerous factors affecting the decision-making process. In order to help in the decision-making process, this study presents the contemporary maintenance strategies in a systematic manner. In a previous study (Kothamasu et al., 2006), these strategies were classified into repair and prevent classes only. With the developments of autonomous maintenance and design out maintenance (DOM), it was fair to include continuous improvement class. It will help managers and practitioners to identify, according to organization policy, appropriate maintenance strategy alternatives for the asset. A benchmark set of state-of-the-art maintenance strategies are laid out with their applications. The industrial case studies discussed in this study summarizes the optimal maintenance strategies for respective industries. Also, most critical criteria are identified from the existing studies for various industries that can help maintenance practitioners in acknowledging the critical factors and making appropriate decisions. Evaluation parameters for the maintenance strategy selection (MSS) generally conflict with each other, and considering the difficulty of quantifying the qualitative measures, it is a challenging task to determine the optimal trade-off. In order to overcome these challenges, popular MCDM approaches, demonstrating effective results across different industries are discussed with their limitations and applications. Decision-makers can refer this study to identify best suitable decision-making technique for the MSS problem in the industry of their choice. Maintenance managers and engineers can refer the case studies illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 to analyse the MSS techniques proposed by previous studies with industry-specific applications. Social implications: This study is an attempt to provide a reference point for research scholars interested in the field of maintenance management and/or development of maintenance strategy framework. This study provides a critical state-of-the-art review of efforts made in the field of MSS. The prominent maintenance strategies being implemented in contemporary industries are discussed with respective case studies. Interested researchers and academicians can familiarize themselves with these strategies and their distinct features in this study. In order to guide future studies and provide a reference point for academicians, MSS critical criteria used in extant literature are identified and classified into a comprehensive benchmark framework. Moreover, the industrial case studies are discussed with the most critical criteria of MSS for different industries and which strategy is most suitable for the respective industries based on these criteria. Table 1 presents different MCDM techniques and their hybrid applications for solving MSS problem that can help researchers in identifying research gaps. Future research can be directed at addressing the limitation of MCDM approach employed in existing studies and comparing the differences in results obtained by the proposed approach. Different industrial case studies with considered maintenance strategy alternatives are presented in Table 2, which can help researchers in identifying the industries that have not been studied yet. Moreover, not all of the existing studies are carried out by considering all the presented benchmark strategies, which can be addressed in future studies by interested researchers. More detailed discussion on research gaps is presented in the following section. Originality/value: From the analysis of the extant literature, the authors could observe that the decision-making process adopted in numerous studies was limited to the classical maintenance strategies and not inclusive of aggressive maintenance strategy alternatives. To overcome these limitations and help maintenance managers in the decision-making, this study depicts the contemporary maintenance strategies, critical evaluation criteria and MCDM frameworks (employed to solve the MSS problem with industrial case studies) in a structured manner.",Maintenance practices | Maintenance strategies | Maintenance strategy selection | Multi-criteria decision-making,5,0,,,,undefined,

In this technique, the irrelevant or redundant features in a single-view data have equal chances with the important features to be selected for training a classifier, leading to misclassification. To overcome this problem, this article proposes a novel algorithm, called multi-view rank-based random forest (MVRRF). The proposed algorithm builds a set of decision trees from multi-view data by using a rank-based feature selection strategy. The main advantages of our method are that (i) it extends the RF algorithm for multi-view learning, and (ii) it reduces the chances of irrelevant and redundant feature selection, and thus it usually improves the accuracy, generalizability and robustness of the classification models. The aim of our study is to predict the match result of the game League of Legends in electronic sports (eSports). Thus, the eSports teams can define trustworthy strategies through important features. The proposed method can be successfully used in other fields as well as eSports. The experiments that were conducted on a publicly available eSports dataset show that the proposed MVRRF algorithm (93.32%) outperforms the standard RF algorithm (86.38%) on multi-view data in terms of accuracy.

It is of great significance for the connotation analysis and application characterization of massive interactive data. Particularly, during major epidemics or disasters, how to provide business services safely and securely is crucial. Specifically, providing users with resilient and guaranteed communication services is a challenging business task when the communication facilities are damaged. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with flexible deployment and high maneuverability, can be used to serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to establish emergency networks. However, it is challenging to control multiple UAVs to provide efficient and fair communication quality of service (QoS) to users due to their limited communication service capabilities. In this paper, we propose a learning-based resilience guarantee framework for multi-UAV collaborative QoS management. We formulate this problem as a partial observable Markov decision process and solve it with proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a policy-based deep reinforcement learning method. A centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm is used, where the experience collected by all UAVs is used to train the shared control policy. Each UAV takes actions based on the partial environment information it observes. In addition, the design of the reward function considers the average and variance of the communication QoS of all users. Extensive simulations are conducted for performance evaluation. The simulation results indicate that (1) the trained policies can adapt to different scenarios and provide resilient and guaranteed communication QoS to users, (2) increasing the number of UAVs can compensate for the lack of service capabilities of UAVs, (3) when UAVs have local communication service capabilities, the policies trained with PPO have better performance compared with the policies trained with other algorithms.",Communication service | Deep reinforcement learning | Multi-UAV | QoS-aware | System resilience | Unmanned business,3,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

We also exploit methods from empirical likelihood theory in statistics to improve predictive performance by constraining baseline covariates, without requiring parametric models. We combine the merits of both proposals to optimize a hybrid reparameterized likelihood.

We show that any factual definition of harm is incapable of identifying harmful actions in certain scenarios, and show that standard machine learning algorithms that cannot perform counterfactual reasoning are guaranteed to pursue harmful policies following distributional shifts. We use our definition of harm to devise a framework for harm-averse decision making using counterfactual objective functions. We demonstrate this framework on the problem of identifying optimal drug doses using a dose-response model learned from randomized control trial data.

There are many different ways of attribution for various Machine-learning models, including ones designed for specific models or ""model agnostic""attribution methods - ones that do not require a specific model to achieve importance values. These attribution methods are valued because of their easily understood nature. While evaluation procedures exist such as generality and precision for rule-based explanation methods, these have not been used on attribution methods until recently. A recent experiment by Ratul et al. [1] proved that the two most popular local model-agnostic attribution methods, LIME and SHAP, have poor precision and generality. In this paper, we propose a new attribution method, the Generality and Precision Shapley Attributions (GAPS).

In particular, factoring a graph adjacency matrix may well reveal, depending on the specific f actor properties, higher order structure. The latter describes global graph properties better compared to first order connectivity patterns such as vertex degrees. The Boolean semiring factorization of an adjacency matrix yields a product of two smaller and sparser matrices where the former contains disjoint fundamental vertex subsets and the latter combinations thereof. Therefore, the first factor represents community structure and the second has the cross connections between them. In this way graph partitioning and dimensionality reduction are simultaneously achieved. Because of the nature of the Boolean semiring, most common linear algebraic solvers cannot be applied. Moreover, the exact factorization is NP hard. To address these limitations, a genetic algorithm has been developed with evolutionary operations tailored to heuristically compute said factorization which offers interpretability and a high parallelism potential. Besides graph mining the major applications of the Boolean semiring factorization include role mining in enterprise database and operating system realms, curriculum design, and graph flows under inflexible uniqueness constraints. The results obtained by applying the proposed genetic algorithm to synthetic graph benchmarks are very encouraging.",Boolean semiring | dimensionality reduction | genetic algorithm | graph mining | matrix factorization | role mining,0,0,,,,5030952,

Increasing information and collaborative approaches in big data leads to more dimensions to analyze the prediction leads to inaccuracy for a recommendation. To improve the cold chain process, intend a Real-time Cold chain forecasting model for agricultural logistic transportation using feature centric deep neural classification for a seasonal recommendation. Initially, the preprocess was carried out to reduce the noise present in the seasonal collective and cold chain logistic dataset, which contains information about agriculture in stock detail, production, seasonal, and daily requirement ratio.

The problem addresses the extra rented warehouse (RW) to store extra inventories if the manufacturer is producing more inventories than their owned warehouse (OW) capacity. Now, the problem is which inventories should be used first with minimum cost and minimum deterioration. To solve this problem, we have assumed a MFIFO (mixed first in first out) dispatching policy and constant demand rate over a finite time horizon. Along with these we have also assumed an inspection policy during the supply chain to separate deteriorated items and a carbon tax policy is also considered to control carbon emissions. The rate of deterioration depends on the number of inspections. If the number of inspections increases, it minimizes the rate of the decaying process. Due to the adoption of the inspection policy, the supply chain moves toward a green supply chain as it removes deteriorated inventories that minimize further decay by contact, and simultaneously separated deteriorated products can be utilized for other purposes that solve the problem of the disposal of deteriorating inventories and reduce emission generation. We have also established the uniqueness of the established model. The motto of solving the mathematical model is to find the values of the optimum value of N, the number of cycles, and n, the number of inspections that helps to minimize total cost.

The assessment also includes investigating the effect of splitting the training/test sets using the split method of 80:20 split and 70:30 split. The results indicate that GBM tends to be faster and more potent than DNN due to its lower processing requirements. GBM is hence the preferred method for credit scoring prediction.

The experimental results show that the deep neural network technique does not necessarily perform better than the traditional machine learning technique for missing value imputation. In particular, the random forest imputation model performs the best, whereas the k-nearest neighbour method is the second best imputation model in terms of the AUC rates and type II errors. The performance in improvement of prediction models after performing feature normalisation is heavily dependent on the chosen classification technique.

These protocols are manual, work-intensive, and expensive. All of the above have led to a shift towards automatic data-driven approaches to estimate the cf, including Machine Learning (ml) solutions. Unfortunately, as in other sectors of interest, the decision-making processes involved in these solutions lack transparency from the end user's point of view, who must blindly trust their outcomes compared to intelligible traditional manual approaches. In this research, manual and automatic methodologies for cf estimation were reviewed, taking into account their transparency limitations. This analysis led to the proposal of a new explainable ml solution for automatic cf calculations through bank transaction classification. Consideration should be given to the fact that no previous research has considered the explainability of bank transaction classification for this purpose. For classification, different ml models have been employed based on their promising performance in similar problems in the literature, such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Recursive Neural Networks. The results obtained were in the 90 % range for accuracy, precision, and recall evaluation metrics. From their decision paths, the proposed solution estimates the co2 emissions associated with bank transactions. The explainability methodology is based on an agnostic evaluation of the influence of the input terms extracted from the descriptions of transactions using locally interpretable models. The explainability terms were automatically validated using a similarity metric over the descriptions of the target categories.

Traditionally, it refers to the concern that the borrower may not be able to collect the sequence and interest. The challenges in lenders' threat assessment are a lack of adequate data storage and retrieval, problematic delays caused by a lack of access to the relevant data at the right time, extended lead times that lead their shipments at risk, and demand for speedier deliveries.

An individual can interpret the perturbation as an “action” to obtain the desired decision results. Existing CE methods focus on providing an action, which is optimized for a given single instance. However, these CE methods do not address the case where we have to assign actions to multiple instances simultaneously. In such a case, we need a framework of CE that assigns actions to multiple instances in a transparent and consistent way. In this study, we propose Counterfactual Explanation Tree (CET) that assigns effective actions with decision trees. Due to the properties of decision trees, our CET has two advantages: (1) Transparency: the reasons for assigning actions are summarized in an interpretable structure, and (2) Consistency: these reasons do not conflict with each other. We learn a CET in two steps: (i) compute one effective action for multiple instances and (ii) partition the instances to balance the effectiveness and interpretability.

However, the multi-channel service has an extra overhead coordinating channel selection to identify which channel is available to send messages to customers because of the disparate nature of the integrated channels. Machine learning can be used to determine channels for communication in a customer alert system used by financial services institutions (FSIs). This work offers a machine-learning-enabled channel selection and management method based on Tug Of War (TOW) algorithm. The framework proposed will be based on the TOW dynamics algorithm. TOW uses a modified learning technique based on addition and subtraction's reward/loss principle. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy by prototyping the proposed framework in a customer alert system termed the ML-Enabled MCM system. Messaging channels such as SMS, Email, Twitter Direct Messages, Instagram Direct Messages, Telegram, and Facebook Direct Messages were integrated with an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) responsible for channel management. The new design reveals that the machine learning-enabled MCM system can learn and adapt quickly in response to channel feedback and make quick decisions about which channels a customer can receive messages on while maintaining balance within the system.

The enormous amount of experimental and computational data, both existing and being generated, is complex but presents excellent opportunity to better comprehend complex problems. This massive amount of raw data needs to be stored and interpreted in order to advance our knowledge in heat transfer applications. The present study considers both forward and inverse DL modeling approaches. In this chapter, we review both approaches using either available experimental data or by generating synthetic, computational data. The forward problem is often well posed, and a numerical or experimental solution can be accomplished with any specified accuracy of computation. In contrast, inverse problem solving is challenging due to the potential for multiple solutions and other difficulties.

Once the risk occurs, it will have a great impact on the trading entities and the trading market. Therefore, it is a top priority to avoid the trade risk of the commodity market from the source. However, traditional entity credit inspection methods have the following drawbacks: single data source, fixed pattern, and fixed particles. These problems lead to the difficulty of entity inspection of market transactions, low reliability, and a high risk of existence. A dynamic entity intelligent inspection service mode based on multi-source data fusion is proposed in this paper. First, for this service mode, the detection technology of multi-source data fusion is used to solve the problem of a single data source. Second, dynamic inspection techniques are used to solve the problem of modal granularity fixation. Finally, the complete process of enterprise service is proposed. Through the service mode and inspection technology proposed in this paper, the entity access qualification can be fed back in an all-round and multi-level way. Before bulk commodity trading, the trading platform can make a comprehensive, multi-directional, and reliable cognition of the trading entity information.

Random matrix theory is used to obtain the degree of randomness of the data and the overall correlation characteristics of the data through statistical analysis of the energy spectrum and eigenstates of complex systems. Using the results of random matrix theory on the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix, the energy of each subspace is estimated, and the estimated energy is then used to construct the subspace weighting matrix. The problem of reliable finite-Time stability of the model under several types of uncertain time-lagged bounded transfer probability Markov jump parameter compatibility indicators is also explored. The four basic theoretical issues, namely, value orientation, construction basis, construction principles, and conceptual model of the sports training work evaluation index system, are studied. This paper takes the construction of a sports training evaluation index system as the research object and uses the literature method, expert interview method, questionnaire survey method, data analysis method, Delphi method, and hierarchical analysis method as the main research methods to construct a set of sports training evaluation index system as the research task, to enrich the idea of sports training evaluation work, and to provide a reference for the future government to be able to develop a sports training evaluation index system that is in line with the development of the times. The research method was used to collect the opinions of experts. The subjective opinions given by experts were collected using the assignment method, and the weight coefficients of each index were calculated using the AHP hierarchical analysis method. The result is that the index of basic conditions (0.3591) has the largest weight in the whole system. After that, organization and management (0.1911), work effectiveness (0.1376), staffing (0.103), activity development (0.0828), financial and fund management (0.0562), publicity and reporting (0.0382), and material provision (0.032) are in order.

Several works have revealed that using a fixed attack strategy to generate AEs during the whole training phase limits the model robustness and propose to exploit different attack strategies at different training stages to improve robustness. But those multi-stage handcrafted attack strategies need much domain expertise, and the robustness improvement is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial training by introducing the concept of 'learnable attack strategy', dubbed LAS-AT, which learns to automatically produce attack strategies to improve the model robustness. Our framework is composed of a target network that uses AEs for training to improve robustness, and a strategy network that produces attack strategies to control the AE generation.

Research attention subsequently shifted to FinTech innovations (alternative finance, cryptocurrency and blockchain, machine-based methods for financial analysis and forecasting, including artificial intelligence), as well as risk and regulatory issues. IS work on FinTech started to emerge from 2015 onwards, initially focusing on mobile payment systems and peer-to-peer lending. However, the body of work at the intersection of FinTech and IS is still small. Our review sheds light on several opportunities for future research, including financial inclusion, the impacts arising from COVID-19, and the emergence of new business models, such as Banking as a Service (BaaS).",AlgoTrading | Banking as a Service (BaaS) | COVID-19 | Cryptocurrency | Financial Inclusion | Literature Review | Machine-based Learning | RegTech | Research Trends | Risk and Regulation,6,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,ARC,LP200301118,Australian Research Council

It helps the financial industries to grant credits or loans to each deserving applicant with zero or minimal risks. However, developing an accurate and effective credit scoring model is a challenging task due to class imbalance and the presence of some irrelevant features. Recent researches show that ensemble learning has achieved supremacy in this field. In this paper, we performed an extensive comparative analysis of ensemble algorithms to bring further improvements in the algorithm oversampling, and feature selection (FS) techniques are implemented. The relevant features are identified by utilizing three FS techniques, such as information gain (IG), principal component analysis (PCA), and genetic algorithm (GA). Additionally, a comparative performance analysis is performed using 5 base and 14 ensemble models on three credit scoring datasets. The experimental results exhibit that the GA-based FS technique and CatBoost algorithm perform significantly better than other models in terms of five metrics, i.e., accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), F1-score, Brier score (BS), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS).",,3,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Water quality prediction plays a vital role in protecting and enhancing water resources. Changes in water quality are influenced by many factors, both long-term and short-term. Therefore, according to water quality changes’ periodic and nonlinear characteristics, this paper considered dissolved oxygen as the research object and constructed a neural network model combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) to predict dissolved oxygen index in water quality. Firstly, we prepro-cessed the water quality data set obtained from the water quality monitoring plat-form. Secondly, we used a CNN network to extract local features from the preprocessed water quality data and transferred time series with better expressive power than the original water quality information to the LSTM layer for predic-tion. We choose optimal parameters by setting the number of neurons in the LSTM network and the size and number of convolution kernels in the CNN net-work. Finally, LSTM and the proposed model were used to evaluate the water quality data. Experiments showed that the proposed model is more accurate than the conventional LSTM in the prediction effect of peak fitting.

However, the importance of interpretable and explainable decision-making processes within AI-based systems is becoming crucial to provide transparency and confidence among end-users from diverse backgrounds. Acceptance of these black-box models considerably depends on to which extent the users or technical personnel understand and trust the underlying mechanism. However, ML methods and models are getting more sophisticated and transparent progressively. Though the domain experts understand the mathematical principle, they still face difficulties expressing the mechanism for a wide audience. To address this issue, a recent research domain—Explainable AI (XAI), has emerged intending to generate the contextual explanatory model for practical deployment. In this chapter, we systematically review and examine the existing literature and contribution of XAI in different domains. The presented taxonomy contains our investigation on the necessity of explaining and contextualizing methods and models in the AI ecosystem. Moreover, our study includes prospects in this field and the possible consequences of more explainable and interpretable ML models concerning different domains.

This difficulty is addressed by recent model-agnostic methods that provide explanations after the training process. As a result, the current guidelines’ requirement for “interpretability from the start” is not met. As a result, such methods are only useful as a sanity check after the model has been trained. In an abstract scenario, “interpretability from the start” implies imposing a set of soft constraints on the model’s behavior by infusing knowledge and eliminating any biases. By inserting knowledge into the objective function, we present a Multicriteria technique that allows us to control the feature effects on the model’s output. To accommodate for more complex effects and local lack of information, we enhance the method by integrating particular knowledge functions. As a result, a Deep Learning training process that is both interpretable and compliant with modern legislation has been developed.

For the multisource financial data of enterprise, this is also a time-consuming and laborious task for financial personnel. At the same time, it is difficult to find the correlation between multiple sources of data and then formulate financial data that guides the development of the enterprise. With the advancement of intelligent algorithms, an intelligent classification algorithm similar to the SAS model has emerged, which can realize the intelligent classification of enterprise financial multisource data and accurately predict the future development trend, which is extremely beneficial to the development and performance of the enterprise. This article mainly combines the financial intelligence classification model SAS with clustering and decision tree methods to classify the financial multisource information and uses the neural network method to carry out the future development trend of corporate finance. The research results show that the maximum error of enterprise financial classification after using the intelligent classification method is only 3.71% and that the forecast error of the future development trend of enterprise finance is only 1.77%.

Nevertheless, it is fairly challenging to identify frauds with highly imbalanced dataset because ratio of non-fraud companies is very high compared to fraudulent ones. Intelligent financial statement fraud detection systems have therefore been developed to support decision-making for the stakeholders. However, most of current approaches only considered the quantitative part of the financial statement ratios while there has been less usage of the textual information for classifying, especially those related comments in Chinese. As such, this paper aims to develop an enhanced system for detecting financial fraud using a state-of-the-art deep learning models based on combination of numerical features that derived from financial statement and textual data in managerial comments of 5130 Chinese listed companies' annual reports. First, we construct financial index system including both financial and non-financial indices that previous researches usually excluded. Then the textual features in MDA section of Chinese listed company's annual reports are extracted using word vector. After that, powerful deep learning models are employed and their performances are compared with numeric data, textual data and combination of them, respectively. The empirical results show great performance improvement of the proposed deep learning methods against traditional machine learning methods, and LSTM, GRU approaches work with testing samples in correct classification rates of 94.98% and 94.62%, indicating that the extracted textual features of MDA section exhibit promising classification results and substantially reinforce financial fraud detection.",deep learning | feature selection | Fraud detection | LSTM | text analytics,9,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

Linear modeling methods such as logistic regression are often adopted since they offer an acceptable balance between precision and interpretability. Linear methods, however, are not well equipped to handle categorical predictors with high cardinality or to exploit nonlinear relations in the data. As a solution, data preprocessing methods such as weight of evidence are typically used for transforming the predictors. The binning procedure that underlies the weight-of-evidence approach, however, has been little researched and typically relies on ad hoc or expert-driven procedures. The objective in this paper, therefore, is to propose a formalized, data-driven and powerful method. To this end, we explore the discretization of continuous variables through the binning of spline functions, which allows for capturing nonlinear effects in predictor variables and yields highly interpretable predictors that take only a small number of discrete values. Moreover, we extend the weight-of-evidence approach and propose to estimate the proportions using shrinkage estimators. Together, this method offers an improved ability to exploit both nonlinear and categorical predictors to achieve increased classification precision while maintaining the interpretability of the resulting model and decreasing the risk of overfitting.

Indeed, the blockchain technology has been used for securing the data transaction among the agents, e.g., generators, consumption points, and the central control unit of the microgrid according to the hash function concept. To make the proposed framework more realistic, a stochastic framework based on fuzzy cloud theory is developed to capture the uncertainty effects from the renewable energy sources, as well as market electricity price and the hourly load demand. Each drop in the fuzzy cloud recognizes a deterministic framework for the EMP with a specific probability value. The EMP in a renewable microgrid with different types of power sources such as wind turbine (WT), photovoltaics (PV), storage, fuel cell (FC), and microturbine (MT) in a stochastic environment is a challenging task that requires a global solver for getting to the optimal operating point. To this end, a smart optimization method based on the θ-firefly algorithm (θ-FA) is designed which would look for the optimal solution in the polar space rather than the traditional Cartesian space. In addition, an adaptive modification approach based on local and global search operators is devised which can help the algorithm to make a mature optimization process.

Analytical tools needed for the analysis of such algorithms, including a semilinear Feynman–Kac formula, a new class of seminorms and their recursive inequalities, are also introduced.

More specifically, the paper presents the case of a principal imposing an incentive-control structure upon an agent to force him to follow the principal's interests for which he was hired, against the tendency of the agent to follow his own interests. Findings point toward the principal's difficulty in controlling the behaviour of the agent through incentives and monitoring; instead, best results are obtained when hiring agents who care for their reputation and refrain from unprofessional behaviours. The implication is that if we consider that it might be difficult to identify this characteristic at the time of the agent's hiring, the best criterion will be to look for low levels of greed in the agent. This conclusion goes in some way against current practices of looking for aggressive agents for the generation of higher profits. Nevertheless, it should be noted that these potential benefits might actually fade away if the agent follows his own interests, instead of the principal's. Another interesting result points to the restricted, although necessary, role of monitoring to control the agent's behaviour, a result that goes against current research interests on measures of corporate governance.

Researchers have developed complex credit scoring models using statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help banks and financial institutions to support their financial decisions. Neural networks are considered as a mostly wide used technique in finance and business applications. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to help bank management in scoring credit card clients using machine learning by modelling and predicting the consumer behaviour with respect to two aspects: the probability of single and consecutive missed payments for credit card customers. The proposed model is based on the bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to give the probability of a missed payment during the next month for each customer. The model was trained on a real credit card dataset and the customer behavioural scores are analysed using classical measures such as accuracy, Area Under the Curve, Brier score, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and H-measure. Calibration analysis of the LSTM model scores showed that they can be considered as probabilities of missed payments. The LSTM model was compared to four traditional machine learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, multi-layer perceptron neural network, and logistic regression. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional methods, the consumer credit scoring method based on the LSTM neural network has significantly improved consumer credit scoring.",Behavioural scoring | Bidirectional LSTM | Classification | Neural networks,12,1,repositoryvor,Green,ZU,R20053,Zayed University

The prediction of corporate bankruptcy has been extensively studied in economics, accounting and decision sciences over the past two decades. The corporate bankruptcy prediction has been a matter of talk among academic literature and professional researchers throughout the world. Different traditional approaches were suggested based on hypothesis testing and statistical modeling. Therefore, the primary purpose of the research is to come up with a model that can estimate the probability of corporate bankruptcy by evaluating its occurrence of failure using different machine learning models. As the dataset was not well prepared and contains missing values, various data mining and data pre-processing techniques were utilized for data preparation. Within this research, the task of resolving the issues induced by the imbalance between the two classes is approached by applying different data balancing techniques. We address the problem of imbalanced data with the random undersampling and Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE). We used five machine learning models (support vector machine, J48 decision tree, Logistic model tree, random forest and decision forest) to predict corporate bankruptcy earlier to the occurrence. We use data from 2009 to 2013 on Poland manufacturing corporates and selected the 64 financial indicators to be broken down. The main finding of the study is a significant improvement in predictive accuracy using machine learning techniques. We also include other economic indicators ratios, along with Altman's Z-score variables related to profitability, liquidity, leverage and solvency (short/long term) to propose an efficient model. Machine learning models give better results while balancing the data through SMOTE as compared to random undersampling. The machine learning technique related to decision forest led to 99% accuracy, whereas support vector machine (SVM), J48 decision tree, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Random Forest (RF) led to 92%, 92.3%, 93.8% and 98.7% accuracy, respectively, with all predictive financial indicators. We find that the decision forest outperforms the other techniques and previous techniques discussed in the literature. The proposed method is also deployed on the web to assist regulators, investors, creditors and scholars to predict corporate bankruptcy.",Corporate bankruptcy prediction | Data mining | Deployment | Imbalanced dataset | Machine learning | Random undersampling | SMOTE,19,0,,,,undefined,

Similar designs can also be found in other contexts, such as counterparty credit risk for example. The framework is based on Fourier transform methods as they allow to derive convenient closed analytical formulas for a broad spectrum of underlying dynamics.

Among them, credit risk assessment is a major application of machine learning for financial institutions to evaluate credit of users and detect default or fraud. Simple white-box models, such as Logistic Regression (LR), are usually used for credit risk assessment, but not powerful enough to model complex nonlinear interactions among features. In contrast, complex black-box models are powerful at modeling, but lack of interpretability, especially global interpretability. Fortunately, automatic feature crossing is a promising way to find cross features to make simple classifiers to be more accurate without heavy handcrafted feature engineering. However, existing automatic feature crossing methods have problems in efficiency on credit risk assessment, for corresponding data usually contains hundreds of feature fields. In this work, we find local interpretations in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) of a specific feature are usually inconsistent among different samples. We demonstrate this is caused by nonlinear feature interactions in the hidden layers of DNN. Thus, we can mine feature interactions in DNN, and use them as cross features in LR. This will result in mining cross features more efficiently. Accordingly, we propose a novel automatic feature crossing method called DNN2LR. The final model, which is a LR model empowered with cross features, generated by DNN2LR is a white-box model. We conduct experiments on both public and business datasets from real-world credit risk assessment applications, which show that, DNN2LR outperform both conventional models used for credit assessment and several feature crossing methods. Moreover, comparing with state-of-the-art feature crossing methods, i.e., AutoCross, the proposed DNN2LR method accelerates the speed by about 10 to 40 times on financial credit assessment datasets, which contain hundreds of feature fields.",automated machine learning | credit risk assessment | default prediction | feature crossing | interpretability,4,0,,,,undefined,

The call for using clean energy and attaining carbon neutrality worldwide has also attracted research attention in the field of low-carbon and clean planning. Because of the growth of the energy system construction cycle together with the utilization of various types of energies, multi-stage planning considering the uncertainty and construction time sequence in a long time scale has gradually become the primary research direction for planning RIES. The uncertainty of multi-energy load growth and the energy price fluctuation in a long time scale considerably affects the construction and economy of the final planning scheme. Aiming to solve the problems of incomplete load data, low accuracy of single load forecasting, and weak regularity of the energy price fluctuation, this study proposes a multi-stage scenario tree generation method based on the conditional generative adversarial network–random forest–Markov chain. And a method of energy price upper and lower boundary determination is based on the multi-index artificial neural network method for analyzing and solving energy price fluctuation. A multi-stage stochastic planning model of RIES is built herein to minimize the comprehensive cost, including the construction investment and regional operation costs, energy hub income, and carbon emission reduction. Finally, the Beichen district of Tianjin, China is considered a case for verifying the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model and method. Results show that the construction time sequence of the energy hub substantially affects the planning scheme. Energy hub construction in advance benefits the energy hub income and carbon emission reduction; however, the initial stage requires more investment, which affects the planning and construction of renewable energy. Compared with a single-stage deterministic planning scheme, the optimized multi-stage stochastic planning scheme reduces the number of idle facilities and benefits cost recovery, energy hub income, coverage scenarios, and carbon emission reduction.",Carbon emission reduction | Construction time sequence | Long-term planning uncertainty | Multi-stage scenario tree | RIES multi-stage stochastic planning,39,0,,,NSFC,52061635103,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In order to tackle the impact of bias in data, researchers developed a variety of specialized machine learning algorithms which are able to satisfy different fairness constraints imposed on the model. Group fairness constraints do not fit standard machine learning formulations easily due to their non-differentiable nature.

In the proposed method, to improve the high quality of the training dataset, the RF algorithm is adopted to select the important factors as the input feature of the model, and the selected factors are further verified by the previous studies. CNN is used to construct the performance prediction model which outputs the I-V polarization curve. In particular, batch normalization and dropout methods are applied to enhance model generalization. The effectiveness of the CNN-based prediction model is evaluated on the real I-V polarization curve dataset. Experiment results indicate that the prediction curves of the proposed model have good agreement with the real curves.

This aspect would be particularly valuable for banking institutions with branch networks all over the world. A further benefit is the cost reductions that are a result of replacing several approaches with a single global one. Instead of local demographic parameters, a solid theoretical model based on Markov random fields (MRFs) has been developed. The use of MRFs means a reduction in the amount of information required.

According to the findings in this research, the most related metric and the best variable to slice on to get a predictable sliced dataset turn out to be ""Solvency Ratio""both in Chinese and Polish data. Simultaneously, using two different sliced datasets, the accuracy of machine learning and deep learning methods is improved.

Different approaches have been used in the literature, the majority of which can be classified within the so-called econometric framework and sometimes also referred to as the macro-to-micro approach. Another strand of literature relies on the modelling of directly observable quantities, the so-called micro-to-macro approach. Based on this second line of research, we propose a new multivariate stochastic process to model simultaneously price returns, trading volumes and the time interval between changes in trades, price and volume. The proposed model is based on a generalization of semi-Markov chain models and copulas and is motivated by empirical evidence that the three mentioned variables are correlated and long-range autocorrelated. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we compared our model with real data from the Italian stock market and show that it can reproduce many empirical pieces of evidence.

For the pricing of derivative products, to avoid arbitrage opportunities, the fundamental theorem of asset pricing requires the existence of an equivalent martingale measure under which the discounted price process is a (local) martingale. In the semimartingale setting, the traditional approach of risk-neutral valuation uses a change of measure invoking Girsanov's theorem. This approach often destroys the tractability of the process which is undesirable for quantitative finance applications. To overcome these limitations, we employ a transformation based on the concept of intertwining relationships that allows us to convert Markovian semigroups into a pricing semigroup while keeping its tractability. In order to illustrate the usefulness of this approach, we apply it to exponential Lévy, positive self-similar, and generalized CIR processes that all fall within the class of polynomial processes introduced by Cuchiero et al. (2012). Furthermore, for the jump CIR class, relying on recent work of Patie and Savov (2019), we provide an eigenvalues expansion of the pricing semigroup and carry out some numerical experiments.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of processes for biodiesel production and use, fast and accurate modeling tools are required for their design, optimization, monitoring, and control. Data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated superior predictive capability compared to conventional methods for modeling such highly complex processes. Among the available ML techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) technology is the most widely used approach in biodiesel research. The ANN approach is a computational learning method that mimics the human brain's neurological processing ability to map input-output relationships of ill-defined systems. Given its high generalization capacity, ANN has gained popularity in dealing with complex nonlinear real-world engineering and scientific problems. This paper is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing various ML technology applications, with a particular focus on ANN, to solve function approximation, optimization, monitoring, and control problems in biodiesel research. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using ML technology in biodiesel research are highlighted to direct future R&D efforts in this domain. ML technology has generally been used in biodiesel research for modeling (trans)esterification processes, physico-chemical characteristics of biodiesel, and biodiesel-fueled internal combustion engines. The primary purpose of introducing ML technology to the biodiesel industry has been to monitor and control biodiesel systems in real-time; however, these issues have rarely been explored in the literature. Therefore, future studies appear to be directed towards the use of ML techniques for real-time process monitoring and control of biodiesel systems to enhance production efficiency, economic viability, and environmental sustainability.",Artificial neural network | Biodiesel systems | Control | Machine learning | Modeling | Transesterification,189,0,,,HENU,212101510005,Henan University

The main problem in executing credit/debit card fraud detection technique is the availability of limited amount of fraud related data like transaction amount, transaction date, transaction time, address, and vendor category code related to the frauds. It is the truth of mobile internet world that there are billions of potential places and e-commerce websites where a credit/debit card can be used by fraudulent people for online transactions and payments which make it exceedingly thorny to trace the pattern of frauds. Moreover, the problem of fraud detection in cloud— Internet of Things (IoT) based smart societies has numerous constraints like continuous change in the behavior of normal and fraudulent persons, the fraudulent people try to develop and use new method for executing frauds, and very little availability of frauds related bench mark data sets. In this research article, the authors have presented logistic regression based k-fold machine learning technique (MLT) for fraud detection and prevention in cloud-IoT based smart societal environment. The k-fold method creates multiple folds of bank transactions related data before implementing logistic regression and MLT. The logistic regression performs logic based regression analysis and the intelligent machine learning approach performs registration, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning, training, and reinforcement learning steps on the received bank transactions data. The implementation of proposed methodology and its further analysis using intelligent machine learning tools like ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, confusion matrix, mean-recall score value, and precision recall curves for European banks day-to-day transactions related bench mark data set reveal that the proposed methodology is efficient, accurate, and reliable for detecting frauds in cloud-IoT based smart societal environment.",Cloud-IoT based distributed environment | Confusion matrix | Fraud detection | Fraudulent | Logistic regression | Machine learning | Mean-recall-score | ROC curve,11,0,,,BISR,0012,Birla Institute of Scientific Research

As major methodological contributions: we compute the Nash equilibrium of the problem using CV@R and considering conjectural variations; we derive analytical relationships between the futures and the spot market outcomes and study the implications of demand and marginal cost uncertainty, as well as the level of the players’ risk aversion, on market equilibrium; we introduce the concept of risk-adjusted expectation to derive the futures market price as a function of the players’ expected losses or profits in the spot market; and we use consistent spot and wholesale price derivatives to calculate the players’ reaction functions. Finally, we illustrate our model with several numerical examples in the context of the Spanish electricity market, studying how the shape of the forward curve and the relationship between spot and futures prices depend on seasonality, risk aversion, generators’ market power, and hydrological resources.

This paper presents PRICURE, a system that combines complementary strengths of secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and differential privacy (DP) to enable privacy-preserving collaborative prediction among multiple model owners. SMPC enables secret-sharing of private models and client inputs with non-colluding secure servers to compute predictions without leaking model parameters and inputs. DP masks true prediction results via noisy aggregation so as to deter a semi-honest client who may mount membership inference attacks. We evaluate PRICURE on neural networks across four datasets including benchmark medical image classification datasets.

It combines clustering, combinatorics-based algorithms and dependence structure in order to tackle and simplify complex problems, without disregarding the hierarchy of or interconnections between the relevant variables. These problems typically arise in real-world applications and computations involving big data in finance, insurance and banking, where experts are confronted with counting variables in monitoring random events. In this new approach, combinatorial distributions of random events are the core element. In order to deal with the high-dimensional features of the problem, the combinatorial techniques are used together with a clustering approach, where groups of variables sharing common characteristics and similarities are identified and the dependence structure within groups is taken into account. The original problems can then be modeled using new classes of copulas, referred to here as clusterized copulas, which are essentially based on preliminary groupings of variables depending on suitable characteristics and hierarchical aspects. The book includes examples and real-world data applications, with a special focus on financial applications, where the new algorithms' performance is compared to alternative approaches and further analyzed. Given its scope, the book will be of interest to master students, PhD students and researchers whose work involves or can benefit from the innovative methodologies put forward here.

We then survey the techniques used for supply chain risk identification between 1980 and 2020 and determine their suitability along with their limitations in meeting the requirements of identifying risks in the networked supply chain environment.

Central to our survey is the question of under which conditions a complex macro-system of interacting agents may or may not coordinate on the rational equilibrium outcome. A general finding is that under positive expectations feedback (strategic complementarity)—where optimistic (pessimistic) expectations can cause a boom (bust)—coordination failures are quite common. The economy is then rather unstable, and persistent aggregate fluctuations arise strongly amplified by coordination on trend-following behavior leading to (almost-)self-fulfilling equilibria. Heterogeneous expectations and heuristics switching models match this observed micro and macro behavior surprisingly well.

These issues can have substantial economic implications because they may hinder the development and mass adoption of machine learning. In light of this, the purpose of this paper was to determine, from a positive economics point of view, whether the free use of machine learning models maximizes aggregate social welfare or, alternatively, regulations are required. In cases in which restrictions should be enacted, policies are proposed. The adaptation of current tort and anti-discrimination laws is found to guarantee an optimal level of interpretability and fairness. Additionally, existing market solutions appear to incentivize machine learning operators to equip models with a degree of security and privacy that maximizes aggregate social welfare.

Plant closures adversely affect societal entities beyond the specific plant being shut down, such as the parent company and the local community. Motivated by an aluminum producer, we study if mitigating these hardto-assess broader impacts of a shutdown is financially viable using the plant s operating flexibility. Academic/practical relevance: Our social commerce perspective toward managing shutdown decisions deviates from the commonly used asset value maximization objective in merchant operations. Identifying operating policies that delay or decrease the likelihood of a shutdown without incurring a significant asset value loss supports socially responsible plant shutdown decisions. Methodology:We formulate a constrained Markov decision process to manage shutdown decisions and limit the probability of future plant closures. We provide theoretical support for approximating this intractable model using unconstrained stochastic dynamic programs with modified shutdown costs and explore two classes of operating policies. Our first policy leverages anticipated regret theory, and the second policy generalizes, using machine learning, production-margin heuristics used in practice. We compute the former and latter policies using a least squares Monte Carlo method and combining this method with binary classification, respectively. Results: Anticipated-regret policies possess desirable asymptotic properties absent in classificationbased policies. On instances created using real data, anticipated-regret and classificationbased policies outperform practice-based production-margin strategies. Significant reductions in shutdown probability and delays in plant closures are possible while incurring small asset value losses. Managerial implications: A plant s operating flexibility provides an effective lever to balance the social objective to reduce closures and the financial goal to maximize asset value. Adhering to both objectives requires combining short-Term commitments with external stakeholders to avoid shutdown with longer-Term internal efforts to reduce the probability of plant closures.",approximate dynamic programming | energy and commodity operations | least squares Monte Carlo | merchant production | shutdown decisions | socially responsible operations,7,0,repositoryam,Green,IFD,4106-00009B,Innovationsfonden

To solve the above problems, a deep transfer-learning-based dynamic reinforcement learning (DRL-DTL) is presented and applied in the intelligent tightening system.

Then, a dynamic expert library is established to improve the adaptability of algorithm to the changing environment.

These include component lifetime distributions, which have the disadvantage of being binary, in the sense of only telling whether the component has failed or not. Failure rate functions model ageing in a more satisfactory way than lifetime distributions. However, failure rates cannot be observed for a single component, and are therefore not tractable in practical applications. To mitigate this, a theory for modeling deterioration via stochastic processes developed. Various processes have been suggested, such as Brownian motion with drift and compound Poisson processes (CPP) for modeling usage and damage from sporadic shocks and gamma processes to model gradual ageing. However, none of these processes are able to capture jump clustering. To allow for clustering of jumps (failure events), we suggest an alternative approach in this paper: To use self-exciting jump processes to model stochastic deterioration of components in a system where there may be clustering effects in the degradation. Self-exciting processes excite their own intensity, so large shocks are likely to be followed by another shock within a short period of time. Furthermore, self-exciting processes may have both finite and infinite activity. Therefore, we suggest that these processes can be used to model degradation both by sporadic shocks and by gradual wear. We illustrate the use of self-exciting degradation with several numerical examples. In particular, we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected lifetime of a component with self-exciting degradation. As an illustration, we also estimate the lifetime of a bridge system with independent components with identically distributed self-exciting degradation.",jump processes | maintenance modeling | Self-exciting stochastic processes | stochastic deterioration,0,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,Norges Forskningsråd

Then, the tree-based convolution is applied to extract state vectors from the tree structure, and each node is abstracted into a parameterized action. Next, the reward function is designed based on a range of evaluation metrics of imbalanced classification. Finally, a popular deep reinforcement learning algorithm called Multi-Pass DQN is employed to find an optimal decision tree building policy.

To deal with this problem, several approaches were proposed, for example sampling dependent over-sampling, undersampling, classification level enhancements, or the combination of two or more classifiers. The major problem however is that most solutions have a negative class, a computational cost, a storage problem, or a long training period.

To achieve the interpretability of complex machine learning models, one approach consists in explaining the outcome of machine learning models through input features attribution. Attribution consists in scoring the features of an input instance by establishing how important is each feature value in a fixed instance to obtain a specific classification outcome from the machine learning model. In literature, several attribution methods are defined for specific machine learning models (e.g., neural networks) or more general ones that are model agnostic (i.e., can interpret any machine learning models). Attribution is particularly appreciated for its easy understanding of the interpretation, which is the attribution. In domains involving safety, security, and fairness, properties of the explanation such as precision and generality are crucial to establish human trust in machine learning interpretability and then on the machine learning model itself. However, even if precision and generality are clearly defined in rule-based interpretation models, they are not defined or measure on attribution models. In this work, we propose a general methodology to estimate the degree of precision and generality in attribution methods. In addition, we propose a way to measured consistency in attribution between two attribution methods. Our experiments focus on the two most popular model agnostic attribution methods, SHAP and LIME, and we evaluate them to two real applications in the field of attack detection. Our proposed methodology shows in these experiments that both SHAP and LIME lack precision, generality, and consistency and that still more investigation in the attribution research field is required.",Attribution Methods | Evaluation Methodology | Machine Learning Interpretability,2,0,,,NSF,22-001,National Science Foundation

Modern emergency response operations are beginning to use Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) that have the ability to drop sensor robots to precise locations. sUAS can provide longer-term persistent monitoring that aerial drones are unable to provide. Despite the relatively low cost of these assets, the choice of which robotic sensing systems to deploy to which part of an industrial process in a complex plant environment during emergency response remains challenging. This paper describes a framework for optimizing the deployment of emergency sensors as a preliminary step towards realizing the responsiveness of robots in disaster circumstances.

Decisions on mitigation include implementing repairs or shutting down the plant.

However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, that are carefully-crafted perturbations introduced on input images to fool a DNN model. Adversarial attacks may prevent the application of DNNs in security-critical tasks: consequently, relevant research effort is put in securing DNNs. Typical approaches either increase model robustness, or add detection capabilities in the model, or operate on the input data. Instead, in this paper we propose to detect ongoing attacks through monitoring performance indicators of the underlying Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In fact, adversarial attacks generate images that activate neurons of DNNs in a different way than legitimate images. This also causes an alteration of GPU activities, that can be observed through software monitors and anomaly detectors. This paper presents our monitoring and detection system, and an extensive experimental analysis that includes a total of 14 adversarial attacks, 3 datasets, and 12 models.

Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting, the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of such 'naive updating' when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen. We complement these findings with a discussion of several potential routes to overcome these issues.",,5,0,,,ATI,EP/T001569/1,Alan Turing Institute

E-commerce has seen rapid development, e.g., Alibaba has nearly 12 hundred million customers in China. Click-Through Rate (CTR) forecasting is a primary task in the e-commerce advertisement system. From the traditional Logistic Regression algorithm to the latest popular deep neural network methods that follow a similar embedding and MLP, several algorithms are used to predict CTR. This research proposes a hybrid model combining the Deep Interest Network (DIN) and eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM) to perform CTR prediction robustly. The cores of DIN and xDeepFM are attention and feature cross, respectively. DIN follows an adaptive local activation unit that incorporates the attention mechanism to adaptively learn user interest from historical behaviors related to specific advertisements. xDeepFM further includes a critical part, a Compressed Interactions Network (CIN), aiming to generate feature interactions at a vectorwise level implicitly. Furthermore, a CIN, plain DNN, and a linear part are combined into one unified model to form xDeepFM. The proposed end-to-end hybrid model is a parallel ensemble of models via multilayer perceptron. CIN and xDeepFM are trained in parallel, and their output is fed into a multilayer perceptron. We used the e-commerce Alibaba dataset with the focal loss as the loss function for experimental evaluation through online complex example mining (OHEM) in the training process.

The main methods used in this book are generalized integral transforms and heat potentials. To find a semi-closed form solution, we need to solve a linear or nonlinear Volterra equation of the second kind and then represent the option price as a one-dimensional integral. Our analysis shows that these methods are computationally more efficient than the corresponding finite-difference methods for the backward or forward Kolmogorov PDEs (partial differential equations) while providing better accuracy and stability. We extend a large number of known results by either providing solutions on complementary or extended domains where the solution is not known yet or modifying these techniques and applying them to new types of equations, such as the Bessel process.

Here, we discuss how to warm-start quantum optimization with an initial state corresponding to the solution of a relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem and how to analyze properties of the associated quantum algorithms. In particular, this allows the quantum algorithm to inherit the performance guarantees of the classical algorithm. We illustrate this in the context of portfolio optimization, where our results indicate that warm-starting the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is particularly beneficial at low depth. Likewise, Recursive QAOA for MAXCUT problems shows a systematic increase in the size of the obtained cut for fully connected graphs with random weights, when Goemans-Williamson randomized rounding is utilized in a warm start.

Many “reject inference” methods try to exploit the data available from the rejected applicants in the learning process. However, most of these methods are empirical and lack of formalization of their assumptions, and of their expected theoretical properties. We formalize such hidden assumptions in a general missing data setting for some of the most common reject inference methods. It reveals that hidden modelling is mostly incomplete, thus prohibiting to compare existing methods within the general model selection mechanism (except by financing “non-fundable” applicants). So, we assess performance of the methods on both simulated data and real data (from CACF, a major European loan issuer). Unsurprisingly, no method seems uniformly dominant.

A stochastic optimal control model was developed to model public debt dynamics based on the debt accounting identity, where the interest-growth differential obeys a continuous random process. This stochasticity represents both the interest rate risk of public debt and the variability of the growth rate of the nominal Gross Domestic Product combined. The optimal fiscal policy was analyzed in terms of the model param-eters. The model was simulated, and results were visualized. The insolvency risk was demonstrated by examining the variance of the optimal process. The model was amended with hidden credit risk premia and fiscal multipliers, which forces the debt dynamics to be nonlinear in the debt ratio. The results, on the other hand, confirm that the volatility of the interest-growth differential is crucial in terms of sovereign solvency and in addition, it demonstrates the large risks stemming from the multiplier effect, which underlines the need for prudent debt management and fiscal policy.",Debt dynamics | Fiscal policy | Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equa-tion | Nonlinear dynamics | Public debt | Stochastic optimal control,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

Further borrower profiling analyses underscore the importance of personalization in debt collections. Moreover, we demonstrate the vast economic value of personalization in debt collections as it not only improves loan recovery rate (by 8.11%), but also enables platforms to allocate limited resources to cover more delinquent loans.

The limit of ATEE is supported by numerical evidence as an effective approximation to that of the finite number of entities by comparing it with Monte-Carlo simulation. The key insight revealed by our analysis is that one CCP can lose its superiority to bilateral clearing and multiple CCPs after a critical time after market distress happens, as observed in our extensive numerical experiments.

In order to retain considerable profits in time and to avoid serious losses possibly caused by sudden and huge price changes toward the opposite direction as predictions, a position closing function is implemented in the trading rule.

However, solving CMEs is a formidable task. This task is complicated due to the nonlinear nature of the reactions and the size of the networks which result in different realizations. Most importantly, the exponential growth of the size of the state-space, with respect to the number of different species in the system makes this a challenging assignment. When the biochemical system has a large number of variables, the CME solution becomes intractable. We introduce the intelligent state projection (ISP) method to use in the stochastic analysis of these systems. For any biochemical reaction network, it is important to capture more than one moment: this allows one to describe the system’s dynamic behaviour. ISP is based on a state-space search and the data structure standards of artificial intelligence (AI). It can be used to explore and update the states of a biochemical system. To support the expansion in ISP, we also develop a Bayesian likelihood node projection (BLNP) function to predict the likelihood of the states. Results: To demonstrate the acceptability and effectiveness of our method, we apply the ISP method to several biological models discussed in prior literature. The results of our computational experiments reveal that the ISP method is effective both in terms of the speed and accuracy of the expansion, and the accuracy of the solution. This method also provides a better understanding of the state-space of the system in terms of blueprint patterns. Conclusions: The ISP is the de-novo method which addresses both accuracy and performance problems for CME solutions. It systematically expands the projection space based on predefined inputs. This ensures accuracy in the approximation and an exact analytical solution for the time of interest. The ISP was more effective both in predicting the behavior of the state-space of the system and in performance management, which is a vital step towards modeling large biochemical systems.",Bayesian likelihood node projection | Biochemical reaction networks | chemical master equation | intelligent state projection | stochastic,1,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this paper, we propose MetaNChemo, a multidisciplinary end-to-end framework to build a chemometric system from the very production of chemoresistive sensors, through the data sampling and pre-processing phases necessary to calibrate such sensors, to the identification and the assessment of the most suitable artificial intelligence models able to supports the detection of the concentration of a target gas in the air. Without loss of generality, we focus our attention on carbon monoxide (CO) as our target gas. However, materials scientists may take full advantage of MetaNChemo, since its data-driven approach can accommodate very specific requirements of those environmental monitoring applications that have to properly detect one or more target gas.

The input parameters to the optimization model are rate of returns of bonds which are obtained using credit ratings assuming that credit ratings of bonds follow a semi-Markov process. Modeling credit ratings by semi-Markov processes has several advantages over Markov chain models, i.e., it addresses the ageing effect present in the credit rating dynamics. The transition probability matrices generated by semi-Markov process and initial credit ratings are used to generate rate of returns of bonds. The empirical performance of the proposed model is analyzed using the real data.

Following this understanding that asset price bubbles are generated by market failures, we present a framework for explosive semimartingales that is based on the antagonistic combination of (i) an excessive, unstable pre-crash process and (ii) a drawdown starting at some random time. This unifying framework allows one to accommodate and compare many discrete and continuous time bubble models in the literature that feature such market inefficiencies. Moreover, it significantly extends the range of feasible asset price processes during times of financial speculation and frenzy and provides a strong theoretical background for future model design in financial and risk management problem settings. This conception of bubbles also allows us to elucidate the status of rational expectation bubbles, which, by design, suffer from the paradox that a rational market should not allow for misvaluation. While the discrete time case has been extensively discussed in the literature and is most criticized for its failure to comply with rational expectations equilibria, we argue that this carries over to the finite time ""strict local martingale""-approach to bubbles.",bubble decomposition | explosive processes | Financial bubbles | financial crashes | infinite horizon bubbles | strict local martingale approach,3,0,,,,undefined,

Online payment services (OPSs) are the typical models of Internet finance, and the fraudulent transaction in OPSs is also a typical fraud pattern. The method of identifying fraudulent transactions by constructing a fraud detection model based on machine learning has become a promising idea for online payment anti-fraud. In the process of constructing fraud detection models, the feature engineering is the most critical step. It is also one of the most time-consuming and specialized steps in the relevant area. In the study of feature engineering, the existing online payment fraud detection models are mainly carried out by experts in the form of manual construction based on business knowledge. However, there are many fraud scenarios in OPSs where the process of feature construction is so different. Artificial feature construction methods can no longer meet the increasing demand of anti-fraud. An important way to solve this problem is to automate feature engineering. In the field of Internet financial anti-fraud, the expressibility and interpretability of features play a pivotal role. It is helpful to understand the original source fields and their construction process of important features. This is useful for mining and analyzing the characteristics of fraud methods and follow-up improvement rules engines. These are of great significance for fraud detection models. Therefore, the interpretability of the model method is particularly important. Usually, the optimization of detection accuracy is carried out under the premise of ensuring interpretability. This paper proposed a lightweight, tree-structure, high efficiency and scalable automatic feature engineering method for fraud detection of online payment. The method is as follows: (1) The method has low requirements on the calculation conditions and little dependence on the dataset samples. To realize this advantage, it used the tree structure model to construct the features. (2) The method can construct complex features in the depth level and various types of features in the breadth level. To realize this advantage, it utilized the unique process of feature construction at the node and the time-dependent updating mechanism of the transforming function weight vector. (3) Cross-scenario multiplex can be implemented in different online payment scenarios. This advantage is realized by the customized transforming function that can apply to different scenarios. (4) The constructed features are interpretable. The transforming function and the tree model were combined to realize the expressible process of feature construction. Finally, the effectiveness of the method was sufficiently validated on two typical real-world OPS datasets. For the first, we used the method to automatically generate the features required by the fraud detection model. Then we evaluated its effectiveness on two online network payment transaction datasets. It was verified that our method can reduce the time spent on feature engineering steps from days level to hours level compared with the manual methods. In summary, the method proposed in this paper does well in reducing the complexity of feature engineering, reducing labor costs, and improving the overall work efficiency of model development. It provides insights into how to design effective automated feature engineering methods for online payment fraud detection, taking into account both the interpretability and high performance.",Automated feature engineering | Fraud detection | Internet finance | Machine learning | Online payment,4,0,,,,undefined,

This random time can represent many economic and financial settings, such as the default time of a firm for credit risk, and the death time of an insured for life insurance. As the random time cannot be seen before its occurrence, the progressive enlargement of filtration seems tailor-fit to model the larger flow of information that incorporates both the public flow and the information about the random time. In this context, our interest focuses on the following challenges: (a) How to single out the various risks coming from the financial assets, the random time, and their correlations? (b) How these risks interplay and lead to the formation of any risk in the larger flow of information? It is clear that understanding how risks build-up and interact, when one enlarges the flow of information, is vital for an efficient risk management and derivatives' evaluation in those informational markets. Our answers to these challenges are full and complete no matter what the model for the random time is and no matter how the random time is related to the public flow. In fact, we introduce “pure default” risks, and quantify and classify these risks afterward. Then we elaborate our martingale representation results, which state that any martingale in the large filtration stopped at the random time can be decomposed into orthogonal local martingales (i.e., local martingales whose product remains a local martingale). This constitutes our first principal contribution, while our second contribution consists in evaluating various defaultable securities according to the recovery policy, within our financial setting that encompasses any default model, using a martingale “basis.” Our pricing formulas explain the impact of various recovery policies on securities and determine the types of pure default risk they entail.",default/time of death/random horizon | defaultable securities | optional martingale representation | progressively enlarged filtration | risk decomposition | valuation of securities,6,0,repositoryam,Green,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Firstly, a dynamic clustering model is designed using the proposed semi-supervised multi-spatial manifold clustering method to recognize attribute clusters and aggregate new types. When new types are added to this model, it is constantly updated to achieve the automatic evolution of the knowledge base for the diversity of fault. Then, a knowledge evolution model is established by the generative adversarial network algorithm to achieve self-learning and self-optimizing capabilities of the knowledge base. This method learns the distribution of knowledge elements and generates new knowledge elements to optimize the clustering model. Finally, a series of comparative experiments are carried out on bearing datasets to verify the validity of the mentioned framework and models.

As an effective complement to those previous systems, data lakes were devised to store voluminous, varied, and diversely structured or unstructured data in their native formats, for the sake of various analyses like reporting, modeling, data exploration, knowledge discovery, data visualization, advanced analysis, and machine learning. Due to their intrinsic traits, data lakes are thought to be ideal technologies for processing of hybrid biological resources in the format of text, image, audio, video, and structured tabular data. This paper proposes a method for constructing a practical data lake system for processing multimodal biological data using a prototype system named ProtoDLS, especially from the explainability point of view, which is indispensable to the rigor, transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness of the applications in the field. ProtoDLS adopts a horizontal pipeline to ensure the intra-component explainability factors from data acquisition to data presentation, and a vertical pipeline to ensure the inner-component explainability factors including mathematics, algorithm, execution time, memory consumption, network latency, security, and sampling size. The dual mechanism can ensure the explainability guarantees on the entirety of the data lake system. ProtoDLS proves that a single point of explainability cannot thoroughly expound the cause and effect of the matter from an overall perspective, and adopting a systematic, dynamic, and multisided way of thinking and a system-oriented analysis method is critical when designing a data processing system for biological resources.",biological resources | data lake | DIKW | explainability | interpretability | unstructured data | XAI,4,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,61572137,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Solving the steady-state equations, we predict a power law scaling of the probability density function of the intensities close to the critical point n=1 of the Hawkes process, with a nonuniversal exponent, function of the background intensity ν0 of the Hawkes intensity, the average timescale of the memory kernel and the branching ratio n.

While a large body of literature has focused on optimizing and evaluating novel methods in terms of classification accuracy, recent research has acknowledged the existence of asymmetric misclassification costs associated with prediction errors and thus, advocates the usage of alternative evaluation metrics. However, these papers often assume a misclassification cost matrix to be known and fixed for both the training and the evaluation of models, whereas in reality these costs are often uncertain. This paper presents a methodological framework based upon heterogeneous ensemble selection and multi-objective optimization for cost-sensitive business failure prediction that accommodates uncertainty at the level of misclassification costs. The framework assumes unknown costs during model training and accommodates varying degrees of uncertainty during model deployment. Specifically, NSGA-II is deployed to optimize cost space resulting in a set of pareto-optimal ensemble classifiers where every learner minimizes expected misclassification cost for a specific range of cost ratios. An extensive set of experiments evaluates the method on multiple data sets and for different scenarios that reflect the extent to which cost ratios are known during model deployment. Results clearly demonstrate the ability of our method to minimize cost under the absence of exact knowledge of misclassification costs.",Business failure prediction | Cost uncertainty | Cost-sensitive learning | Ensemble selection | Multicriteria optimization | NSGA-II,28,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This paper presents a Deep Learning approach for credit scoring. We have defined the credit score as a cost obtained by a weighted sum of the number of false negative errors (FN) and the number of false positive errors (FP). Our objective was to obtain the lowest possible score. The largest weight is allocated to the indicator FN (this corresponds to the prediction of bad credit as good credit). As a consequence, our best credit score corresponds to minimization of Miss Alarm Rate (MAR) for a given sum of total errors. The proposed model of cost minimization uses state of the art mathematical algorithms and deep learning techniques. In our work, we use optimization algorithms for selecting a deep learning neural network architecture and for finding the optimum hyperparameters. The method is tested using the German credit dataset. The best result leads to a MAR of 3%.",credit scoring | deep learning | optimization,1,0,,,,undefined,

Although small machine learning models can be trained with modest amounts of data, the input for training larger models such as neural networks grows exponentially with the number of parameters. Since the demand for processing training data has outpaced the increase in computation power of computing machinery, there is a need for distributing the machine learning workload across multiple machines, and turning the centralized into a distributed system. These distributed systems present new challenges: first and foremost, the efficient parallelization of the training process and the creation of a coherent model.

Many customer churn prediction (CCP) techniques are developed by academics and practitioners to handle the customer churn in order to resolve the problems pertaining to customer retention. However, CCP is not widely studied in the scenario where the company is not having enough historical data due to either been a newly established company or due to the recent start of a new technology or even because of the loss of the historical data. The just-in-time (JIT) approach can be a more practical alternative to address this issue as compared to state-of-the-art CCP techniques.

However, the existing bank loan evaluation system lags behind the financial demands of small and medium-sized enterprises. Most of the standards are designed for large enterprises. In order to meet the financial security standards of banks, these small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) choose to guarantee each other in order to obtain loans. As more and more enterprises are involved, they form complex guarantee networks. It is a double-edged sword for the national economy. On the one hand, these secured loans help businesses to raise funds rapidly during periods of economic growth development. On the other hand, while complex networks can mitigate the risk of corporate defaults in times of economic downturn, they can also lead to large-scale defaults and spread infections. The conventional research on the credit risk of SMEs mainly focuses on the evaluation of individual enterprises, lack of risk assessment for the whole guarantee network default warning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a risk assessment and prediction method for networked-guarantee loans. It includes a probability graph-based default diffusion and prediction model, distributed positive weighted k-nearest neighborhood classification for massive imbalance datasets. We then implement it in a distributed version on Spark framework. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on real-world datasets.

Informally this is a Markov process that behaves conditionally on each regime as an affine process with specific parameters. To facilitate our analysis, specific restrictions are imposed on these parameters. The regime switches are driven by a Markov chain. We prove that the joint process of the Markov chain and the conditionally affine part is a process with an affine structure on an enlarged state space, conditionally on the starting state of the Markov chain. Like for affine processes, the characteristic function can be expressed in a set of ordinary differential equations that can sometimes be solved analytically. This result unifies several semi-analytical solutions found in the literature for pricing derivatives of specific regime switching processes on smaller state spaces. It also provides a unifying theory that allows us to introduce regime switching to the pricing of many derivatives within the broad class of affine processes. Examples include European options and term structure derivatives with stochastic volatility and default.

Due to that the transition function plays a core role for constructing a Markov process, a transition function should be defined from a copula family. For this purpose, the modified partial Dini derivatives of a bivariate copula are defined and applied for defining transition probabilities, and some properties of the modified partial Dini derivatives are proved. A necessary and sufficient condition for the family of the defined transition probabilities to be a transition function is provided. Given a bivariate copula family, a sufficient condition for the existence of a Markov process is provided, where the Markov process has a transition function generated by the modified partial Dini derivatives of the bivariate copula family and the temporal dependence of the Markov process is modeled by the given copula family. The resulting Markov process is named as the copula-based Markov process. Moreover, under some assumptions the consistency of the bivariate copula family under the ∗ product operation is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a Markov process. In terms of copulas, some criteria are provided for a copula-based Markov process to be path right-continuous with left limits or path continuous, and a necessary and sufficient condition for a time-homogeneous copula-based Markov process to be a Feller process is obtained. It is interesting that a Markov process with the transition function generated by the modified partial Dini derivatives of FGM copulas is not a Feller process.

Our model incorporates the market uncertainty in terms of future asset price scenarios based on asset return distributions stemming from the real market data.

The superiority of our model is mainly embedded in solution quality. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of solving complex portfolio optimization problems with tremendous scenarios while maintaining high solution quality in a reasonable amount of time and it has outstanding practical investment implications, such as effective portfolio constructions.",Combinatorial approach | Hybrid algorithm | Learning inheritance | Local search | Population-based incremental learning | Portfolio optimization problem | Stochastic programming,10,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Previous works typically predict the stock price mainly based on its own information, neglecting the cross effect among involved stocks. However, it is well known that an individual stock price is correlated with prices of other stocks in complex ways. To take the cross effect into consideration, we propose a deep learning framework, called Multi-GCGRU, which comprises graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to predict stock movement. Specifically, we first encode multiple relationships among stocks into graphs based on financial domain knowledge and utilize GCN to extract the cross effect based on these pre-defined graphs. To further get rid of prior knowledge, we explore an adaptive relationship learned by data automatically. The cross-correlation features produced by GCN are concatenated with historical records and then fed into GRU to model the temporal dependency of stock prices. Experiments on two stock indexes in China market show that our model outperforms other baselines. Note that our model is rather feasible to incorporate more effective stock relationships containing expert knowledge, as well as learn data-driven relationship.",GCN | Graph Convolutional Network | GRU | Relationship | Stock Movement | Stock Price,27,0,repositoryam,Green,NSFC,2019M663183,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In this way, one of the biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. Recent studies mostly focus on enhancing the classifier performance for credit card default prediction rather than an interpretable model. In classification problems, an imbalanced dataset is also crucial to improve the performance of the model because most of the cases lied in one class, and only a few examples are in other categories. Traditional statistical approaches are not suitable to deal with imbalanced data. In this study, a model is developed for credit default prediction by employing various credit-related datasets. There is often a significant difference between the minimum and maximum values in different features, so Min-Max normalization is used to scale the features within one range. Data level resampling techniques are employed to overcome the problem of the data imbalance. Various undersampling and oversampling methods are used to resolve the issue of class imbalance. Different machine learning models are also employed to obtain efficient results. We developed the hypothesis of whether developed models using different machine learning techniques are significantly the same or different and whether resampling techniques significantly improves the performance of the proposed models. One-way Analysis of Variance is a hypothesis-testing technique, used to test the significance of the results. The split method is utilized to validate the results in which data has split into training and test sets. The results on imbalanced datasets show the accuracy of 66.9% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 70.7% on South German clients credit dataset, and 65% on Belgium clients credit dataset. Conversely, the results using our proposed methods significantly improve the accuracy of 89% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 84.6% on South German clients credit dataset, and 87.1% on Belgium clients credit dataset. The results show that the performance of classifiers is better on the balanced dataset as compared to the imbalanced dataset. It is also observed that the performance of data oversampling techniques are better than undersampling techniques. Overall, the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method performs better than other traditional machine learning classifiers. The Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method gives the best results while utilizing the K-means SMOTE oversampling method. Using one-way ANOVA, the null hypothesis was rejected by a p-value <0.001, hence confirming that the proposed model improved performance is statistical significance. The interpretable model is also deployed on the web to ease the different stakeholders.

Corresponding accounting standards prescribe that expected credit losses (ECLs) be recognized for the impairment of financial instruments, for which the probability of default strongly embodies the included default risk. This paper fills the research gap resulting from a lack of models that expand upon existing risk management techniques, link PD term structures of different risk classes and are compliant with accounting standards, e.g. offering the flexibility for business cycle-related variations. Design/methodology/approach: The author modifies the non-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain model (NHCTMCM) by Bluhm and Overbeck (2007a, 2007b) and introduces the generalized through-the-cycle model (GTTCM), which generalizes the homogeneous Markov chain approach to a point-in-time model. As part of the overall ECL estimation, an empirical study using Standard and Poor’s (S&P) transition data compares the performance of these models using the mean squared error. Findings: The models can reflect observed PD term structures associated with different time periods. The modified NHCTMCM performs best at the expense of higher complexity and only its cumulative PD term structures can be transferred to valid ECL-relevant unconditional PD term structures. For direct calibration to these unconditional PD term structures, the GTTCM is only slightly worse. Moreover, it requires only half of the number of parameters that its competitor does. Both models are useful additions to the implementation of accounting regulations. Research limitations/implications: The tests are only carried out for 15-year samples within a 35-year span of available S&P transition data. Furthermore, a point-in-time forecast of the PD term structure requires a link to the business cycle, which seems difficult to find, but is in principle necessary corresponding to the accounting requirements. Practical implications: Research findings are useful for practitioners, who apply and develop the ECL models of financial accounting. Originality/value: The innovative models expand upon the existing methodologies for assessing financial risks, motivated by the practical requirements of new financial accounting standards.",Credit risk | Expected credit loss | Financial accounting | Probability of default term structure,4,0,,,,undefined,

In recent years, many novel machine learning models have been developed for credit scoring. Among the existing machine learning models, the heterogeneous ensemble model receives much attention because of its superior performance. This paper presents a new heterogeneous ensemble model based on the generalized Shapley value and the Choquet integral. To do this, the model first uses the fuzzy measure to express the interactive characteristics between any two coalitions of base learners. Based on the accuracy and diversity objective function, a linear programming model for determining the fuzzy measure is built. To retain the original information as much as possible in the training stage, the normal fuzzy number is employed to express the base learner predicted values. Then, the generalized Shapley Choquet integral (GSCI) aggregation operator is defined to calculate the comprehensive predicted value of the ensemble model. Based on the defined aggregation operator and linear programming model, a GSCI approach is proposed for ensemble credit scoring. To illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the GSCI approach, an experiment of thirteen machine learning models over four public credit scoring datasets and three real-world P2P leading datasets with large volumes of samples is made. Furthermore, robust tests and comparatives analysis are made to demonstrate the adaptability and performance of the GSCI-based ensemble model.",Credit scoring | heterogeneous ensemble | normal fuzzy number | the Choquet integral | the generalized Shapley function,8,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,CAE,2017TP1026,State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems

One of the key issues is how to represent the non-stationary price series of assets in a portfolio, which is important for portfolio decisions. The existing methods, however, fall short of capturing: 1) the complicated sequential patterns for asset price series and 2) the price correlations among multiple assets. In this paper, under a deep reinforcement learning paradigm for portfolio selection, we propose a novel Relation-aware Transformer (RAT) to handle these aspects. Specifically, being equipped with our newly developed attention modules, RAT is structurally innovated to capture both sequential patterns and asset correlations for portfolio selection. Based on the extracted sequential features, RAT is able to make profitable portfolio decisions regarding each asset via a newly devised leverage operation. Extensive experiments on real-world crypto-currency and stock datasets verify the state-of-the-art performance of RAT.1,.",,20,0,,,NSFC,2018B010107001,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Deep Learning (DL) is already present in many applications ranging from computer vision for medicine to autonomous driving of modern cars as well as other sectors in security, healthcare, and finance. However, to achieve impressive performance, these algorithms employ very deep networks, requiring a significant computational power, both during the training and inference time. A single inference of a DL model may require billions of multiply-and-accumulated operations, making the DL extremely compute- and energy-hungry. In a scenario where several sophisticated algorithms need to be executed with limited energy and low latency, the need for cost-effective hardware platforms capable of implementing energy-efficient DL execution arises. This paper first introduces the key properties of two brain-inspired models like Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Spiking Neural Network (SNN), and then analyzes techniques to produce efficient and high-performance designs. This work summarizes and compares the works for four leading platforms for the execution of algorithms such as CPU, GPU, FPGA and ASIC describing the main solutions of the state-of-the-art, giving much prominence to the last two solutions since they offer greater design flexibility and bear the potential of high energy-efficiency, especially for the inference process. In addition to hardware solutions, this paper discusses some of the important security issues that these DNN and SNN models may have during their execution, and offers a comprehensive section on benchmarking, explaining how to assess the quality of different networks and hardware systems designed for them.",adversarial attacks | AI | area | artificial intelligence | capsule networks | CNNs | computer architecture | convolutional neural networks | data flow | deep learning | deep neural networks | DNNs | efficiency | energy | hardware accelerator | latency | Machine learning | ML | optimization | performance | power consumption | spiking neural networks | VLSI,73,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The central question is how to ensure that the learned model does not treat subgroups in the population unfairly.

Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for the survival of a patient as well as for the quality of life throughout cancer treatment. The aim of this study is to develop improved machine learning models for early diagnosis of breast cancer with high accuracy. In this context, a performance comparison of machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Ensemble Classifiers was performed on a dataset consisting of routine blood analysis combined with anthropometric measurements to diagnose breast cancer. Neighborhood component analysis was applied as a feature selection method to reveal relevant biomarkers that can be used in breast cancer prediction. In order to assess the performance of each proposed classifier model, two different data division procedures such as hold-out and 10-fold cross-validation were employed. Bayesian Optimization algorithm was applied to all classifiers for the maximizing the prediction accuracy. Different performance criteria such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure were used to measure the success of each classifier. Experimental results showed that the Bayesian optimization-based K-Nearest Neighbor performs better than other machine learning algorithms under the hold-out data division protocol with an accuracy of 95.833%.

To price an option, one needs first to choose the model of underlying asset price dynamics, usually in the form of a stochastic differential equation depending on market parameters such as interest rate, asset volatility, etc., then find a solution of the chosen model in some form, and finally obtain the required option price. The asset volatility can be constant (Black-Scholes model), depend on the value of the underlying asset and time (local volatility model), or satisfy some other stochastic differential equation (stochastic volatility model). Exact analytical formula for option price was obtained for Black-Scholes model and a few other models with local and stochastic volatility, but in general case one has to use approximations or numerical methods to evaluate options. We study the problem of European option pricing when volatility is a function of underlying asset value and time. To solve the problem, we use Monte Carlo method to construct the empirical distribution density of underlying asset and then determine the option value using Feynman-Katz formula. The issues of parallelization of the option pricing algorithm and its implementation on computers with multicore processors are discussed.

More specifically, we show how causal Bayesian networks can play an important role to reason about and deal with fairness, especially in complex unfairness scenarios. We describe how optimal transport theory can be leveraged to develop methods that impose constraints on the full shapes of distributions corresponding to different sensitive attributes, overcoming the limitation of most approaches that approximate fairness desiderata by imposing constraints on the lower order moments or other functions of those distributions. We present a unified framework that encompasses methods that can deal with different settings and fairness criteria, and that enjoys strong theoretical guarantees.

This is achieved by integrating the proposed profit-based measure into the prediction model and optimizing the decision threshold to identify the optimal backorder strategy.

Their classic application is only possible if the conditional probability distributions of future states are determined solely by the current operational state.

The empirical analysis results show that the introduction of deep learning in the construction of investment strategy models is conducive to improving the ability of investors to capture KD indicator trading signals. Therefore, in the process of determining investment strategies, an investment model with deep learning as the core can be constructed. Not only that, through empirical analysis of a large number of stocks, it can be found that the investment strategy model based on deep learning is a typical high-probability profit strategy, which is conducive to reducing investment risk by analysing investment methods, thereby improving profitability at a low-risk level.",behaviour monitoring | Deep learning | stock investment behaviour | strategy,7,0,,,,undefined,

The SPI of anemophilous trees, which varies substantially from year to year, reflects the flowering intensity. This intensity is regulated by two factors: weather conditions during flower formation and the inner resource for assimilation. A deterministic approach has to date been employed for predicting SPI, in which the forecast is made entirely by parameters. However, given the complexity of the masting mechanism (which has intrinsic stochastic properties), few attempts have been made to apply a stochastic model that considers the inter-annual SPI variation as a stochastic process. We propose a hidden Markov model that can integrate the stochastic process of mast flowering and the meteorological conditions influencing flower formation to predict the annual birch pollen concentration. In experiments conducted, the model was trained and validated by using data in Hokkaido, Japan covering 22 years. In the model, the hidden Markov sequence was assigned to represent the recurrence of mast years via a transition matrix, and the observation sequences were designated as meteorological conditions in the previous summer, which are governed by hidden states with emission distribution. The proposed model achieved accuracies of 83.3% in the training period and 75.0% in the test period. Thus, the proposed model can provide an alternative perspective toward the SPI forecast and probabilistic information of pollen levels as a useful reference for allergy stakeholders.",Birch pollen forecast | HMM | Intra-annual variation | Mast flowering | State-space model | Stochastic process,21,0,,,,undefined,

A key challenge facing P2P lending platforms is accurately predicting the default probability of the borrower of each loan using the default prediction model, which effectively helps the P2P lending platform avoid credit risks. The traditional default prediction model based on machine learning and statistical learning does not meet the needs of P2P lending platforms in terms of default risk prediction because for data-driven P2P lending, credit data have a large number of missing values, are high-dimensional and have class-imbalanced problems, which makes it difficult to effectively train the default risk prediction model. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new default risk prediction model based on heterogeneous ensemble learning. Three individual classifiers, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a deep neural network (DNN) and logistic regression (LR), are used simultaneously with a liner weight ensemble strategy. In particular, this model is able to process missing values. After generating discrete and rank features, this model adds missing values to the model for self-training. Then, the hyperparameters are optimized by the XGBoost model to improve the performance of the prediction model. Finally, compared with the benchmark model, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction results.

Weather index insurance has emerged as a promising market-based risk financing mechanism. However, to develop a suitable weather index insurance mechanism it is essential to incorporate the distribution of underlying weather and climate risks to a specific event model that can minimize intra-seasonal basis risk. In this paper we investigate the erratic nature of rainfall patterns in Kenya using Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS) rainfall data from 1983 to 2017. We find that the patterns of rainfall are fractional, both erratic and persistent, which is consistent with the Noah and Joseph effects that are well known in mathematics. The erratic nature of rainfall emerges from the breakdown of the convergence to a normal distribution. Instead we find that the distribution about the average is approximately lognormal, with an almost 50% higher chance of deficit rainfall below the mean than adequate rainfall above the mean. We find that the rainfall patterns obey the Hurst law and that the measured Hurst coefficients for seasonal rainfall pattern across all years range from a low of 0.137 to a high above 0.685. To incorporate the erratic and persistent nature of seasonal rainfall, we develop a new approach to weather index insurance based upon the accumulated rainfall in any 21-day period falling below 60% of the long-term average for that same 21-day period. We argue that this approach is more satisfactory to matching drought conditions within and between various phenological stages of growth.",,8,1,repositoryam,Green,USAID,ES/L012235/1,United States Agency for International Development

We estimate the parameters in the default intensity by using Expectation–Maximization algorithm with real market data under three different practical default models. Applications to pricing of credit default swap (CDS) is also discussed. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the results under our models with real recession periods in US. The results demonstrate that our model is able to capture the hidden features and simulate credit default risks which are critical in risk management and the extracted hidden economic states are consistent with the real market data.

If these actions fail, collectors could seek legal proceedings. The operations management challenge in this setting is to decide which of these actions to take, how long to take them, and in what sequence to take them. Ideally, this collection policy should depend on how the defaulter has been performing during the collection process so far. In particular, it should take into account how many payments the defaulter has made under the current action, compared with how long that action has been tried. Other potential considerations aside, the objective of a collections policy typically is to maximize the recovery rate, i.e., the percentage of the defaulted debt that is recovered in the collections process. In this paper, we use a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to find an optimal policy of what action to undertake in the next period given the current information on the individual debtor’s repayment performance thus far.

The first aspect is evaluated by means of the expected value of a dynamic entropy measure. The second one is solved by computing the evolution of the total credit spread over time. Moreover, the covariance between countries’ total spread allows the understanding of any contagions in the EU. The methodology is applied to real data of 24 European countries for the three major rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.

In state-transition models (STMs), decision problems are conceptualized using health states and transitions among those health states after predefined time cycles. The naive, commonly applied method (C) for cycle length conversion transforms all transition probabilities separately. In STMs with more than 2 health states, this method is not accurate. Therefore, we aim to describe and compare the performance of method C with that of alternative matrix transformation methods. Design. We compare 2 alternative matrix transformation methods (Eigenvalue method [E], Schure-Padé method [SP]) to method C applied in an STM of 3 different treatment strategies for women with breast cancer. We convert the given annual transition matrix into a monthly-cycle matrix and evaluate induced transformation errors for the transition matrices and the long-term outcomes: life years, quality-adjusted life-years, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and the performance related to the decisions. In addition, we applied these transformation methods to randomly generated annual transition matrices with 4, 7, 10, and 20 health states. Results. In theory, there is no generally applicable correct transformation method. Based on our simulations, SP resulted in the smallest transformation-induced discrepancies for generated annual transition matrices for 2 treatment strategies. E showed slightly smaller discrepancies than SP in the strategy, where one of the direct transitions between health states was excluded. For long-term outcomes, the largest discrepancy occurred for estimated costs applying method C. For higher dimensional models, E performs best. Conclusions. In our modeling examples, matrix transformations (E, SP) perform better than transforming all transition probabilities separately (C). Transition probabilities based on alternative conversion methods should therefore be applied in sensitivity analyses.",conversion transition probability | cost-effectiveness analysis | markov model | markov transition matrix | state-transition model,1,0,,,,undefined,

Economic analyses usually exclude this phenomenon. In our study, we assess the consequences of an increased productivity in mixed forests for the economically optimal proportions of tree species in forest stands. The economic model applied centers around the Modern Portfolio Theory with the Value-at-Risk as the objective function. The methodological approach encompasses a structured Monte Carlo simulation to generate distributions of returns for different scenarios. Risks include price fluctuations for raw wood as well as natural hazards. The study's major novelty is that it combines well-researched productivity relations in mixed forests with recent empirical survival models for mixed and pure stands to address site variability across Bavaria. We parametrized the model with simulated growth data for Norway spruce and European beech for various climatic and geological conditions. From the results, we conclude that decision makers can increase the Value-at-Risk of forest portfolios when overyielding occurs, by choosing higher shares of beech. Climatic conditions and the extent of overyielding strongly influence optimal stand composition. Using Value-at-Risk as a risk measure that regards both expected returns and their variation, however, leads to the observation that increased risk aversion rather favors higher shares of spruce in forest stands, despite its higher biophysical risks.",Overyielding | Portfolio analysis | Survival probability | Tree species mixture | Value-at-risk,17,0,,,StMELF,28 W-C-4-088-01,"Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten"

Furthermore, we incorporate a sparse online SOM (SOR-SOM) algorithm into our emotional neural network learning algorithm and establish a hybrid sparse online relational SOM-based emotional neural network (Em-SOR-SOM) model, so that those advantages of SOR-SOM can be exploited to further boost the recognition performance of the model.

Since explicit solutions of such PDEs and BSDEs are typically not available, it is a very active topic of research to solve such PDEs and BSDEs approximately. In the recent article (E et al., Multilevel Picard iterations for solving smooth semilinear parabolic heat equations, arXiv:1607.03295) we proposed a family of approximation methods based on Picard approximations and multilevel Monte Carlo methods and showed under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution of a semilinear heat equation that the computational complexity is bounded by O(dε-(4+δ)) for any δ∈ (0 , ∞) where d is the dimensionality of the problem and ε∈ (0 , ∞) is the prescribed accuracy. In this paper, we test the applicability of this algorithm on a variety of 100-dimensional nonlinear PDEs that arise in physics and finance by means of numerical simulations presenting approximation accuracy against runtime. The simulation results for many of these 100-dimensional example PDEs are very satisfactory in terms of both accuracy and speed.

An important limitation of GBM is that, due to the assumption of constant drift and volatility, stylized facts of financial time-series, such as volatility clustering and heavy-tailedness in the returns distribution, cannot be captured. We propose a model where volatility and drift are able to switch between regimes; more specifically, they are governed by an unobservable Markov chain.

Based on consumers’ similarities, we obtain a return pattern trust network by introducing the trust network and collaborative filtering algorithms. Subsequently, we develop two important applications based on the trust network: (i) estimating consumers’ return propensities for product types; (ii) scoring the anomaly for consumers’ returns for one product. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with the real-world data to validate the model’s effectiveness in predicting and tracing consumers’ returns. With the proposed model, we can help retailers improve the conversion rates of selfish consumers, retain honest consumers, and block fraud consumers.",collaborative filtering | machine learning | random walk | return abuse | return pattern,7,0,,,NSFC,2018YFB-1004300,National Natural Science Foundation of China

From the lenders' perspective, maximizing their return on investment is an ultimate goal during their decision-making procedure. In this paper, we explore and address a fundamental problem underlying such a goal: how to represent the two competing risks, charge-off and prepayment, in funded loans. We propose to model both potential risks simultaneously, which remains largely unexplored until now. We first develop a hierarchical grading framework to integrate two risks of loans both qualitatively and quantitatively. Afterward, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning approach to solve this problem by breaking it down into multiple binary classification subproblems that are amenable to both feature representation and risks learning. Particularly, we leverage deep neural networks to jointly solve these subtasks, which leads to the in-depth exploration of the interaction involved in these tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to characterize competing risks for loans in P2P lending via deep neural networks. The comprehensive experiments on real-world loan data show that our methodology is able to achieve an appealing investment performance by modeling the competition within and between risks explicitly and properly. The feature analysis based on saliency maps provides useful insights into payment dynamics of loans for potential investors intuitively.",Competing risks | deep neural networks | peer-to-peer (P2P) lending | return on investment (ROI),25,0,,,,undefined,

The complexity of option pricing/valuation, especially in the case of American basket options, as high dimensional options, has motivated many researchers to develop numerical and simulation-based models. In this paper, a new simulation-based approach for pricing/valuation of American basket option with risk consideration is proposed. Having the prices obtained through Longstaff–Schwartz methodology, which is based on Approximate Dynamic Programming as a risk-neutral approach, we propose a new approach for pricing the American basket option according to the worst-case (pessimistic/risk-averse) and the best-case (optimistic/risk-taking) scenarios. Furthermore, for scenarios generation, we use a Monte Carlo simulation technique using a t-student copula-GARCH method and Extreme Value Theory to handle the nonlinearity of dependencies between variables. To verify the computational efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed methodology, we compare the results of prices obtained through the proposed models with those achieved through the Monte Carlo simulation and the method developed by Ju for European basket options. Moreover, the developed models are tested using out-sample scenarios to explore what would happen if investors bought the option with the obtained prices through three different strategies: risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-taking approaches.",American basket options | Backtesting | Copula-GARCH method | Simulation-based technique,1,0,,,,undefined,

To deal with the corresponding problem, some criteria about stochastic stability and L∞ boundedness are presented for the open-loop positive S-MJSs. Further, some necessary and sufficient conditions for state-feedback controller satisfying L∞ boundedness and positivity of the resulting closed-loop system is established in standard linear programming. Finally, the practical system about the CNM is given to verify the validity of the proposed method.",Linear programming (LP) | semi-Markov jump systems (S-MJSs) | sojourn time | stochastic stability (SSY),146,0,,,NSFC,jp201728,National Natural Science Foundation of China

However, most of them employ a static combiner to combine base classifiers, which do not consider the base classifiers’ characters and their dynamic classification ability. Though some dynamic ensemble methods are proposed, they need to produce a large number of base classifiers or employ a fixed combiner, which limit the generality of the ensemble methods. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic weighted ensemble method for credit scoring. Markov Chain is employed to model the change of each classifier’s classification ability and build a dynamic weighted trainable combiner, which dynamically assign weights to the base classifiers for each sample in the testing set. Through eight credit data sets from the real world, the experimental study demonstrates the ability and efficiency of the dynamic weighted ensemble method to improve prediction performance against the benchmark models, including some well-known individual classifiers and dynamic ensemble methods. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively decrease the misclassification cost, which can reduce risks for the financial institutions.",Credit scoring | Dynamic weighted ensemble | Machine learning | Markov chain,29,0,,,NSFC,71671019,National Natural Science Foundation of China

This missing data problem boils down to a latent variable setting and thus, maximum likelihood estimation is usually conducted using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We illustrate that the EM algorithm is likely to get stuck in local maxima of the likelihood function in this specific problem setting and adapt a stochastic approximation simulated annealing scheme (SASEM) as well as a genetic algorithm (GA) to combat this issue. Above that, our main contribution is to extend our method GA by a rejection sampling scheme, which allows one to derive stochastic monotone maximum likelihood estimates in order to obtain proper (non-crossing) multi-year probabilities of default. We advocate the use of this procedure as direct constrained optimization (of the likelihood function) will not be numerically stable due to the large number of side conditions. Furthermore, the monotonicity constraint enables one to combine structural knowledge of the ordinality of credit ratings with real-life data into a statistical estimator, which has a stabilizing effect on far off-diagonal generator matrix elements. We illustrate our methods by Standard and Poor’s credit rating data as well as a simulation study and benchmark our novel procedure against an already existing smoothing algorithm.",EM algorithm | Embedding problem | Generator matrix | Genetic algorithm | Markov chain | Simulated annealing,6,0,,,,undefined,

Then, we apply RSMC to the monthly time series of the sovereign credit rating of 41 nations from January 1994 to December 2018.

Secondly, we observe that the second tier and non-investment credit ratings in economic contractions are likely to be downgraded. We also detect the continental clustering of economic contractions for the Asian currency and European sovereign debt crises.

We demonstrate that our multiscale convolutional attention-based encoder significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on Morgan fingerprints and a selection of encoders based on SMILES, as well as the previously reported state-of-the-art for multimodal drug sensitivity prediction (R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.89).

Finally, we report a case study of two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors acting on a leukemia cell line, showcasing the ability of the model to focus on informative genes and submolecular regions of the two compounds. The demonstrated generalizability and the interpretability of our model testify to its potential for in silico prediction of anticancer compound efficacy on unseen cancer cells, positioning it as a valid solution for the development of personalized therapies as well as for the evaluation of candidate compounds in de novo drug design. ©",anticancer compounds | attention | CNN | computational systems biology | deep learning | drug discovery | drug discovery | drug sensitivity | drug sensitivity prediction | EC50 | explainability | GDSC | gene expression | IC50 | interpretability | lead discovery | machine learning | molecular fingerprints | molecular networks | multimodal | multiscale | personalized medicine | precision medicine | RNN | SMILES,68,1,repositoryam,Green,H2020,668858,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Using the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model for interest rate and first arrival times of Poisson processes with variable intensities for the occurrences of credit default and counterparty defaults, we derive a mathematical formulation and make a full theoretical investigation. In addition, we develop a full theory for the corresponding infinite horizon problem and establish its connection with the asymptotic long expiry behaviour of finite horizon problem. Furthermore, we establish a connection between two major frameworks for default times: the structure model approach and the intensity model approach. We show that a solution of the structure model can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of solutions of intensity models. Regarded as an important theoretical development, we remove a constraint typically imposed on the parameters of the CIR model; that is, the well-posedness (existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence of parameters) of the mathematical model holds for any empirically calibrated parameters for the CIR model.",CIR model | counterparty risk | Credit default swap | intensity model | structure model,0,0,,,NSF,DMS-1516344,National Science Foundation

Due to the nested non-linear structure of deep learning algorithms, these highly successful models are usually applied in a black-box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what exactly causes them to arrive at their predictions. The effectiveness of these systems is thus limited by the machine’s current inability to explain its decisions and actions to human users. Such a lack of transparency can be a major drawback. For instance, in medical applications the development of methods for visualizing, explaining, and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. Explainable Machine Learning (XAI) or Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) programs aim to create a suite of machine learning techniques that produce more explainable models while maintaining the high level of accuracy. It also enables human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners. Our work summarizes recent developments in this field, and we present three classification tasks wherein we make use of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to explain predictions of deep learning models.

The model exploits a nonparametric kernel approach to estimate P2P loans' expected return and risk under the condition that the historical data of the same borrower is unavailable. Furthermore, we construct a robust mean-variance optimization problem based on relative entropy method for P2P loan investment decision.

The firm may elect to borrow money to purchase product via a revolving line of credit, secured by a compensating balance which determines the credit limit. The line of credit is subject to rollover risk, namely, each period the funding entity may, with some probability, refuse to roll over the line of credit. In response, the firm can search for an alternate funding entity, but in so doing it may incur search costs, primarily in the form of lost sales. The firm optimizes inventory replenishment order sizes and decides whether it should declare bankruptcy, as function of its inventory and available capital. The recent credit crunch has rendered illiquidity a critical concern for funding and operating decisions in enterprises. This paper addresses optimal inventory management in the face of liquidity shocks and supply disruptions. We show that rollover risk and supply disruption are important considerations for firms that rely on external funding. Rollover risk alone results in optimal inventory replenishment policies that differ materially from those specified by traditional supply chain models; differences manifest as state-dependent precautionary replenishment or cash hoarding. Inventory management models which fail to take rollover risk and supply disruption risk into account can prescribe suboptimal replenishment policies. Such policies would generate suboptimal profits for firms that rely on short-term financing to fund their working capital.",Bankruptcy | Financial constraints | Inventory control | Precautionary replenishment | Rollover risk | Supply disruption,7,0,,,,undefined,

Organizations and customers face the hazards arising out of phishing attacks because of anonymous access to vulnerable details. Such attacks often result in substantial financial losses. Thus, there is a need for effective intrusion detection techniques to identify and possibly nullify the effects of phishing. Classifying phishing and non-phishing web content is a critical task in information security protocols, and full-proof mechanisms have yet to be implemented in practice. The purpose of the current study is to present an ensemble machine learning model for classifying phishing websites. Design/methodology/approach: A publicly available data set comprising 10,068 instances of phishing and legitimate websites was used to build the classifier model. Feature extraction was performed by deploying a group of methods, and relevant features extracted were used for building the model. A twofold ensemble learner was developed by integrating results from random forest (RF) classifier, fed into a feedforward neural network (NN). Performance of the ensemble classifier was validated using k-fold cross-validation. The twofold ensemble learner was implemented as a user-friendly, interactive decision support system for classifying websites as phishing or legitimate ones. Findings: Experimental simulations were performed to access and compare the performance of the ensemble classifiers. The statistical tests estimated that RF_NN model gave superior performance with an accuracy of 93.41 per cent and minimal mean squared error of 0.000026. Research limitations/implications: The research data set used in this study is publically available and easy to analyze. Comparative analysis with other real-time data sets of recent origin must be performed to ensure generalization of the model against various security breaches. Different variants of phishing threats must be detected rather than focusing particularly toward phishing website detection. Originality/value: The twofold ensemble model is not applied for classification of phishing websites in any previous studies as per the knowledge of authors.",Ensemble learner | Intelligent systems | Machine learning | Phishing website,18,0,,,,undefined,

These bounds are obtained via univariate Fourier inversion under the assumption that the joint characteristic functions of the Markov-modulated Lévy processes are known.

A general pricing formula for the CDS containing the unknown no default probability is derived first. It is then subsequently shown that the no default probability is equivalent to the price of a down-and-out binary option written on the same reference asset. By simulating the Markov chain with the Monte-Carlo technique, we obtain an approximation formula for the down-and-out binary option, with the availability of which, the calculation of the CDS price becomes straightforward.

The main motivation for this paper is that the positive condition sometimes needs to be considered in S-MJSs and the controller design methods in the existing works have some conservation. To deal with these problems, some sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of positive S-MJSs are established by implying the linear co-positive Lyapunov function. Then, some sufficient conditions for ℒ1-gain constraint are also presented, upon which, a state feedback controller is designed by decomposing the controller gain matrix such that the resulting closed-loop system is positive and stochastically stable with ℒ1-gain performance in the form of standard linear programming (LP). The advantages of the new framework lie in the following facts: (1) the weak infinitesimal operator is derived for S-MJSs under the constraint of positive condition and (2) the less conservative stabilizing controller is designed to achieve the desired control performance.

We penalize the large values by introducing a penalty term expressed as least-squares in order to avoid an explosive number of solutions. This penalty term is known as the Tikhonov regularization parameter. Tikhonov’s regularization is one of the most popular approaches to solve discrete ill-posed problems and, in our case, it plays a fundamental role in order to ensure the convergence to a unique portfolio solution. In this sense, we first provide the parameter conditions under which the penalty regularized expected utility of a given optimal portfolio admits a unique solution. A crucial problem concerning Tikhonov’s regularization is the proper choice of the regularization parameter because it can modify (sometimes significantly) the shape of the original functional. The main objective of this paper is to derive a method for regularization in an optimal way. For solving the problem, the parameters of the regularized poly-linear optimization problem are balanced simultaneously. Then, we prove that the original Markowitz portfolio optimization problem converges to an exact solution (with the minimal weighted norm). We consider a projection gradient method for finding the extremal points including the proof of convergence of the method. We show how to select the parameters of the algorithm in order to guarantee the convergence of the suggested procedure.

While IT aims to match the performance of the benchmark index, EI intents to outperform the same. In this paper, we seek to design portfolios for IT and EI problems using mixed conditional value at risk (MCVaR). We propose to use the two tail MCVaR (TMCVaR) measure to track the index. Optimizing TMCVaR is a linear program which minimizes the upper deviation and the downside deviation from the benchmark index and hence meets the objective of IT. On the other hand, we propose a two step procedure for EI problem. In step one, we design a discrete Markov chain model to filter a few stocks on the basis of their high probability of gain over the benchmark index. In step two, we assign optimal weights to the filtered assets through maximizing any of the two variants of the STARR ratio with MCVaR or the STARR ratio with deviation MCVaR (DMCVaR). Maximizing the STARR ratio either with MCVaR or DMCVaR is a linear program and hence tractable. We analyze the empirical performance of the proposed models over 17 world-wide indices using the rolling window approach. We consider two IT and four EI models from the literature for a comparative analysis. It is exhibited that the proposed IT model outperforms the other two IT models over several performance measures including higher correlation value with the benchmark index and lower tracking error, and the two proposed EI models outperform the other four EI models in achieving higher excess mean returns from the benchmark index.",Deviation measure | Enhanced indexing | Index tracking | Mixed CVaR | STARR ratio,21,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,CSIR,- 09/086(1215)/2015-EMR-I,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India"

Selective ensembles, an important part of this group of systems, are a promising field of research. However, none of them considers the relative costs of Type I error and Type II error for credit scoring when selecting classifiers, which bring higher risks for the financial institutions. Moreover, earlier dynamic selective ensembles usually select and combine classifiers for each test sample dynamically based on classifiers’ performance in the validation set, regardless of their behaviors in the testing set. To fill the gap and overcome the limitations, we propose a new dynamic ensemble classification method for credit scoring based on soft probability. In this method, the classifiers are first selected based on their classification ability and the relative costs of Type I error and Type II error in the validation set. With the selected classifiers, we combine different classifiers for the samples in the testing set based on their classification results to get an interval probability of default by using soft probability. The proposed method is compared with some well-known individual classifiers and ensemble classification methods, including five selective ensembles, for credit scoring by using ten real-world data sets and seven performance indicators.

It realizes random multi-start search, is capable to easily escape from the local optimums, and possesses a high probability to find the optimal subensemble.

The individuals in the population are either stayers, who never leave their initial states or movers who move according to a Markov chain. We, in turn, propose an extension of the MS model by specifying the stayer's probability as a logistic function of an individual's covariates. Such extension has been recently discussed for a continuous time MS but has not been considered before for a discrete time one. This extension allows for an in-sample classification of subjects who never left their initial states into stayers or movers. The parameters of an extended MS model are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. A novel bootstrap procedure is proposed for out of sample validation of the in-sample classification. The bootstrap procedure is also applied to validate the in-sample classification with respect to a more general dichotomy than the MS one. The developed methods are illustrated with the data set on installment loans. But they can be applied more broadly in credit risk area, where prediction of creditworthiness of a loan borrower or lessee is of major interest.",bootstrap | covariate effects | credit risk | discrete-time mover-stayer model | EM algorithm | status classification,4,0,,,,undefined,

The estimator to be designed is assumed to have additive gain perturbations. First, by constructing a comprehensive stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a sufficient condition is given such that the estimation error systems are stochastically admissible and have a prescribed H∞ noise attenuation performance index. Then, based on the matrix inequality decoupling technique, a novel linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition is presented, which guarantees the estimation error systems are stochastically admissible and achieve a prescribed H∞ noise attenuation performance index. Meanwhile, the resilient fuzzy estimator is developed, which can be of full-order or reduced-order.

Accordingly, researchers have developed a myriad of approaches, including statistical and artificial intelligence techniques, to fulfill the task of credit scoring. Recent studies have shown that ensemble methods, which combine multiple algorithms that process different hypotheses to form a new hypothesis, generally outperform the other credit scoring approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous ensemble credit model that integrates the bagging algorithm with the stacking method. The proposed model differs from the extant ensemble credit models in three aspects, namely, pool generation, selection of base learners, and trainable fuser. Four popular evaluation metrics, including accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), AUC-H measure, and Brier score, are employed to measure the performance of alternative models. To confirm the efficiency of the proposed bstacking approach, a wide range of models, including individual classifiers, homogeneous ensemble model, and heterogeneous ensemble model, are introduced as benchmarks.

A significant trend identified throughout the literature study was the increasing prioritisation of automated digital communication in several aspects of debt collection. It is reasonable to assume that this trend will continue to become the industry standard. Four recommendations are made based on the findings of the literature study. Firstly, South African collection agencies should investigate the feasibility of developing an app-based solution to performing collections. Secondly, collection agencies should supplement traditional modelling techniques with other tools, such as those developed in the field of machine learning. Thirdly, collection agencies could consider using speech analytics to obtain insights into call centre agents' performance and adherence to business rules. Lastly, the usage of social media data in collections as well as credit risk modelling in general is recommended as a topic for future study. Significance: A review of the various techniques currently employed in the field of debt collections may serve as useful reference for both academics and those working in debt collections.

In this book, the author provides an extensive probabilistic study of different aspects of drawdown risks, which include the drawdown risk in finite time-horizons, the speed of market crashes (drawdowns), the frequency of drawdowns, the occupation time (time in distress), and the duration of drawdowns. Leveraging the knowledge in stochastic calculus, Lévy processes and optimal stopping, these topics can be considered as problems in advanced applied stochastic processes, and insurance/financial mathematics. The book also offers a number of applications of drawdowns in financial risk management, insurance, and algorithmic trading, including schemes on hedging and synthesizing of maximum drawdown options, (cancellable) drawdown insurance contracts and their fair premium, as well as optimal trading under drawdown-type constraints such as trailing stops. It is the goal of this book to offer a comprehensive characterization of drawdown risks and a handful of applications of drawdown in practice. On the one hand, the book enables interested students and researchers to learn the state-of-art probabilistic research on drawdowns, and explore new mathematical problems that are of practical importance to the financial industry. On the other hand, the book provides financial practitioners with access to a variety of analytically tractable measurements of drawdown risks, and the insight into hedging, optimal trading and execution amid challenges of these risks.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

We prove that the risk measures are defined by a family of risk evaluation functionals (transition risk mappings), which depend on state, time, and the transition function. Their dual representations are risk multikernels of the Markov chain. We introduce the concept of a semiderivative of a risk multikernel and use it to generalize the concept of a generator of a Markov chain. Using these semiderivatives, we derive a system of ordinary differential equations that the risk evaluation must satisfy, which generalize the classical backward Kolmogorov equations for Markov processes. Furthermore, we discuss when such a system can be used to construct a dynamic risk measure.

Such a method takes into account customer needs as a determinant factor in finding the best supplier and considers possible changes in the priorities of customer needs as time passes. In this study a method integrating the analytic network process (ANP), quality function deployment (QFD), and a Markov chain is used to address the supplier selection problem. This proposed method utilizes a Markov chain to trace the changing-priorities of customer needs and find a pattern for them. The ANP–QFD method then connects this pattern to product requirements (PRs) and PRs to supplier qualifications. This combination develops a customer based supplier selection method. The best supplier is selected based on the changing-priorities of customer needs. Although the customer needs priorities keeps changing, one supplier is selected as the best one.

The diffusion coefficients are allowed to have finitely many discontinuities (piecewise Lipschitz) and we prove pathwise uniqueness of solutions to the limiting stochastic PDE. As a corollary, we obtain a representation of the limit as the unique solution to a stochastic McKean-Vlasov problem.

Project performance risks are often passed to the private sector as a contractual risk transfer that is often deterministic and inflexible. In complex projects where there are uncertainties in the scope of work and capital costs, performance risks may need more flexibility with active management on the evolution of project uncertainties over the life of the project's development. Conventional fixed capital structures and project performance measurements cannot capture the evolution of project performance risks and their dynamics. This paper develops a dynamic capital structure approach that explicitly considers the performance risks of complex projects under uncertainty and allows the capital structure to be adjusted proactively to counter their impact on the project value. Unlike most models that focus on the operational phase when revenues are generated, this paper specifically considers the impact of project performance risks that occur during the development phase. This approach identifies the potential threat of default attributable to project performance risks and allows the private-sector-sponsored project company and lenders to make proactive management decisions using a real-options approach. Numerical results show that such a model can add significant value to a PPP project under uncertainty. Furthermore, numerical tests also show that with the flexibility in adjusting the capital structure, the probability of potential default can also be reduced.",,26,0,,,,undefined,

A time-inhomogeneous version is also given that replaces Lévy subordinators with additive subordinators. An attractive feature of MO distributions for applications, such as to portfolio credit risk, is its singular component that yields positive probabilities of simultaneous defaults of multiple obligors, capturing the default clustering phenomenon. The drawback of the original MO fatal shock construction of MO distributions is that it requires one to simulate 2n-1 independent exponential random variables. In practice, the dimensionality is typically on the order of hundreds or thousands of obligors in a large credit portfolio, rendering the MO fatal shock construction infeasible to simulate. The subordinator construction reduces the problem of simulating a rich subclass of MO distributions to simulating an n-dimensional subordinator. When one works with the class of subordinators constructed from independent one-dimensional subordinators with known transition distributions, such as gamma and inverse Gaussian, or their Sato versions in the additive case, the simulation effort is linear in n. To illustrate, we present a simulation of 100,000 samples of a credit portfolio with 1,000 obligors that takes less than 18 seconds on a PC.",additive subordinator | credit risk | default | dependent lifetime | failure | Lévy process | Marshall-Olkin multivariate exponential distribution | reliability | simulation | subordinator,11,0,,,,undefined,

Closed-form formulas for the distribution of default times are obtained which are then applied to solve a number of practical problems such as hedging and pricing credit derivatives. The method and numerical algorithms presented can be applicable to various forms of default intensities.",Credit derivatives | Default risk | Hidden Markov model (HMM) | Reduced-form intensity model,2,0,repositoryam,Green,HKU,17301214,University of Hong Kong

If at some time this ratio is computed to be less than the target critical value of financial crises, governments can take relevant measures to prevent the generation of financial crises in advance Governments’ interference helps to recover the confidence of investors so that they never will again believe in negative information to continue their investment. Results from theoretical and numerical analysis show that the number of investors who hold the belief of potential deterioration of economic situation, and the number of investors who withdraw capital and depart from financial markets for avoiding business loss when governments make appropriate interference are lowered compared to that without appropriate governments’ interference.

Although these studies have shown the context, temporal, and user behavior data carry valuable information, most existing QAC approaches do not fully exploit or even completely ignore these information. We propose a novel Hawkes process based QAC algorithm, comprehensively taking into account the context, temporal, and position of the clicked recommended query completions (a type of user behavior data), for reliable query completion prediction. Our understanding of ranking query completions is consistent with the mathematical rationale of Hawke process; such a coincidence in turn validates our motivation of using Hawkes process for QAC.

As machine learning's use expands across all facets of society, anxiety has emerged about the intrusion of algorithmic machines into facets of life previously dependent on human judgment. Alarm bells sounding over the diffusion of artificial intelligence throughout the private sector only portend greater anxiety about digital robots replacing humans in the governmental sphere. A few administrative agencies have already begun to adopt this technology, while others have clear potential in the near term to use algorithms to shape official decisions over both rulemaking and adjudication. It is no longer fanciful to envision a future in which government agencies could effectively make law by robot, a prospect that understandably conjures up dystopian images of individuals surrendering their liberty to the control of computerized overlords. Should society be alarmed by governmental use of machine-learning applications? We examine this question by considering whether the use of robotic decision tools by government agencies can pass muster under core, time-honored doctrines of administrative and constitutional law. At first glance, the idea of algorithmic regulation might appear to offend one or more traditional doctrines, such as the nondelegation doctrine, procedural due process, equal protection, or principles of reason-giving and transparency. We conclude, however, that when machine-learning technology is properly understood, its use by government agencies can comfortably fit within these conventional legal parameters. We recognize, of course, that the legality of regulation by robot is only one criterion by which its use should be assessed. Agencies should not apply algorithms cavalierly, even if doing so might not run afoul of the law; in some cases, safeguards may be needed for machine learning to satisfy broader, good-governance aspirations. Yet, in contrast with the emerging alarmism, we resist any categorical dismissal of a future administrative state in which algorithmic automation guides, and even at times makes, key decisions. Instead, we urge that governmental reliance on machine learning should be approached with measured optimism about the potential benefits such technology can offer society by making government smarter and its decisions more efficient and just.",,139,0,,,,undefined,

Long run probability of default and expected loss can be estimated by various methods and has fifty-five years of history in literature. After studying literature and empirical models, the Markov chain approach was selected to accomplish lifetime probability of default modeling for Hungarian corporate debt instruments. Empirical results reveal that both discrete and continuous homogeneous Markov chain models systematically overestimate the long term corporate probability of default. However, the continuous nonhomogeneous Markov chain gives both intuitively and empirically appropriate probability of default trajectories. The estimated term structure mathematically and professionally properly expresses the probability of default element of expected loss that can realistically occur in the long-run in Hungarian corporate lending.

The level of credit rating changes from time to time because of random credit risk and, thus, can be modeled by an appropriate stochastic process. Markov chain models have been widely used in the literature to generate credit migration matrices; however, emergent empirical evidences suggest that the Markov property is not appropriate for credit rating dynamics. The purpose of this article is to address the non-Markov behavior of the rating dynamics. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a model based on Markov regenerative process (MRGP) with subordinated semi-Markov process (SMP) to obtain the estimates of rating migration probability matrices and default probabilities. Numerical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model with the help of historical Standard & Poor’s (S&P) credit rating data. Findings: The proposed model implies that rating of a firm in the future not only depends on its present rating, but also on its previous ratings. If a firm gets a rating lower than its previous ratings, there are higher chances of further downgrades, and the issue is called the rating momentum. The model also addresses the ageing problem of credit rating evolution. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is a more general approach to study the rating dynamics and overcome the issues of inappropriateness of Markov process applied in rating dynamics.",Credit rating | Default distribution | Markov regenerative process | Semi-Markov process,10,0,,,,undefined,

However, among the hybrid and ensemble models developed in the literature there has been little consideration given to: 1) combining data filtering and feature selection methods 2) combining classifiers of different algorithms; and 3) exploring different classifier output combination techniques other than the traditional ones found in the literature. In this paper, the aim is to improve predictive performance by presenting a new hybrid ensemble credit scoring model through the combination of two data pre-processing methods based on Gabriel Neighbourhood Graph editing (GNG) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) in the hybrid modelling phase. In addition, a new classifier combination rule based on the consensus approach (ConsA) of different classification algorithms during the ensemble modelling phase is proposed. Several comparisons will be carried out in this paper, as follows: 1) Comparison of individual base classifiers with the GNG and MARS methods applied separately and combined in order to choose the best results for the ensemble modelling phase; 2) Comparison of the proposed approach with all the base classifiers and ensemble classifiers with the traditional combination methods; and 3) Comparison of the proposed approach with recent related studies in the literature. Five of the well-known base classifiers are used, namely, neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), and naïve Bayes (NB). The experimental results, analysis and statistical tests prove the ability of the proposed approach to improve prediction performance against all the base classifiers, hybrid and the traditional combination methods in terms of average accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC) H-measure and the Brier Score.

In particular, the hidden Markov model, the switching linear dynamic system and the naïve Bayes switching linear dynamic system models are considered. These dynamic Bayesian networks provide the means to model system dynamics using the Markovian framework. Given the dynamics, the probability of an impending crisis can be calculated. A unique approach to measuring the ability of a model to predict a crisis is utilised.

Examples include loan portfolios held by financial institutions and fixed-income investors as well as pools of loans backing mortgage-and asset-backed securities. The size of these portfolios can range from the thousands to even hundreds of thousands. Optimal portfolio selection requires the solution of a high-dimensional nonlinear integer program and is extremely computationally challenging. For larger portfolios, this optimization problem is intractable. We propose an approximate optimization approach that yields an asymptotically optimal portfolio for a broad class of data-driven models of loan delinquency and prepayment. We prove that the asymptotically optimal portfolio converges to the optimal portfolio as the portfolio size grows large. Numerical case studies using actual loan data demonstrate its computational efficiency. The asymptotically optimal portfolio's computational cost does not increase with the size of the portfolio.

Our approach, suitable to stable economic regimes as well as stress scenarios, introduces a mathematical framework where the lapse intensity follows a dynamic contagion process, see Dassios and Zhao (2011). This allows to capture both contagion and correlation potentially arising among insureds’ behaviors. In this framework, an external market driven jump component drives the lapse intensity process depending on the interest rate trajectory: when the spread between the market interest rates and the contractual crediting rate crosses a given threshold, the insurer is likely to experience more surrenders. A log-normal dynamic for the forward rates is introduced to build trajectories of an observable market variable and mimic the effect of a macroeconomic triggering event based on interest rates on the lapse intensity. Contrary to previous works, our shot-noise intensity is not constant and the resulting intensity process is not Markovian. Closed-form expressions and analytic sensitivities for the moments of the lapse intensity are provided, showing how lapses can be affected by massive copycat behaviors. Further analyses are then conducted to illustrate how the mean risk varies depending on the model's parameters, while a simulation study compares our results with those obtained using standard practices. The numerical outputs highlight a potential misestimation of the expected number of lapses under extreme scenarios when using classical stress testing methodologies.",Contagion | Dynamic contagion process | Dynamic Policyholders’ behavior | Hawkes process | Interest rates dynamic | Lapse risk | Stress tests | Surrender,14,0,repositoryam,Green,ANR,ANR-13-BS01-0011,Agence Nationale de la Recherche

For a large retail portfolio, data on credit grade migration may be available only in the form of a series of (typically monthly) population transition matrices representing the gross flow of accounts between each pair of credit grades in the given time period. The challenge is to model the transition process on the basis of these aggregate flow matrices. Each row of an observed transition matrix represents a sample from an ordinal probability distribution. Following Malik and Thomas (2012), Feng, Gourieroux, and Jasiak (2008) and McNeil and Wendin (2006), we assume a cumulative link model for these ordinal distributions. Common choices of link function are based on the normal (probit link) or logistic distributions, but the fit to observed data can be poor. In this paper, we investigate the fit of alternative link specifications based on the t-distribution. Such distributions arise naturally when modelling data which arise through aggregating an inhomogeneous sample of obligors, by combining a simple structural-type model for credit migration at the obligor level, with a suitable mixing distribution to model the variability between obligors.",Cumulative link | Heavy-tailed | Logistic | Markov processes | Probit,3,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Regarding this, researchers have developed complex credit scoring models using statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help banks and financial institutions to support their financial decisions. Various models, from easy to advanced approaches, have been developed in this domain. However, during the last few years there has been marked attention towards development of ensemble or multiple classifier systems, which have proved their ability to be more accurate than single classifier models. However, among the multiple classifier systems models developed in the literature, there has been little consideration given to: 1) combining classifiers of different algorithms (as most have focused on building classifiers of the same algorithm); or 2) exploring different classifier output combination techniques other than the traditional ones, such as majority voting and weighted average. In this paper, the aim is to present a new combination approach based on classifier consensus to combine multiple classifier systems (MCS) of different classification algorithms. Specifically, six of the main well-known base classifiers in this domain are used, namely, logistic regression (LR), neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT) and naïve Bayes (NB). Two benchmark classifiers are considered as a reference point for comparison with the proposed method and the other classifiers. These are used in combination with LR, which is still considered the industry-standard model for credit scoring models, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), a widely adopted technique in credit scoring studies. The experimental results, analysis and statistical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed combination method to improve prediction performance against all base classifiers, namely, LR, MARS and seven traditional combination methods, in terms of average accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), the H-measure and Brier score (BS). The model was validated over five real-world credit scoring datasets.",Classification | Classifier ensembles | Consensus approach | Credit scoring | Multiple classifier systems,151,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The experimental results of both methods is the performance of DNN is better than SB. Using 30700 iteration, obtained the MSE value for DNN is more lower than SB. At high iteration amount, DNN still consistent to press the MSE value, and it's different with SB that start slowing down at the earliest iteration point, about 5700 iteration.

Different theoretical tools coming from mathematics and physics have been proposed for the modeling of the physiological and pathological fibrosis. However a complete framework is missing and the development of a general theory is required. This review aims at finding a unified approach in the modeling of fibrosis diseases that takes into account the different phenomena occurring at each level: molecular, cellular and tissue.

They are embedded into the pricing function determining the interest rate of a loan contact, and play crucial role in the credit approval process. However, the currently employed intelligent systems are based on assumptions that completely ignore two key characteristics of financial data, namely their heavy-tailed actual distributions, and their time-series nature. These unrealistic assumptions definitely undermine the performance of the resulting corporate credit rating systems used to inform expert decisions. To address these shortcomings, in this work we propose a novel corporate credit rating system based on Student's-t hidden Markov models (SHMMs), which are a well-established method for modeling heavy-tailed time-series data: Under our approach, we use a properly selected set of financial ratios to perform credit scoring, which we model via SHMMs. We evaluate our method using a dataset pertaining to Greek corporations and SMEs; this dataset includes five-year financial data, and delinquency behavioral information. We perform extensive comparisons of the credit risk assessments obtained from our method with other models commonly used by financial institutions. As we show, our proposed system yields significantly more reliable predictions, offering a valuable new intelligent system to bank experts, to assist their decision making.",Basel framework | Corporate credit rating | Expectation-maximization | Hidden Markov model | Statistical machine learning | Student's-t distribution,34,0,,,H2020,692058,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

We provide numerical tests for the mean-variance optimal investment problem and the uncertain volatility option pricing model, and compare the results to published test cases.",Fully nonlinear PDEs | Mean variance | Monotone approximation schemes | Piecewise constant policy time stepping | Uncertain volatility model | Viscosity solutions,15,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This method is particularly efficient for asset prices modeled by jump-diffusion processes with deterministic volatilities because the geometric mean is always a one-dimensional Markov process regardless of the number of underlying assets and thus is free from the curse of dimensionality.

When repaying such defaulted loans, defaulters tend to oscillate between repayment sequences where the borrower is repaying every period and non-repayment sequences where the borrower is not repaying in any period. This paper develops two models - one a Markov chain approach and the other a hazard rate approach to model such payment patterns of debtors. It also looks at simplifications of the models where one assumes that after a few repayment and non-repayment sequences the parameters of the model are fixed for the remaining payment and non-payment sequences.

Traditional rating-based assessment models cannot meet the needs of individual investors in P2P lending, since they do not provide an explicit mechanism for asset allocation. In this study, we propose a data-driven investment decision-making framework for this emerging market.

Moreover, we formulated the investment decision in P2P lending as a portfolio optimization problem with boundary constraints.

The paper adopts the longitudinal analysis with the first order Markov chain framework. Laplace transform was used with homogenous continuous time assumption, from discretized generator matrix, to generate the transition matrix. Various metrics, i.e.: eigenvalue and eigenvector were used to test the first order Markov chain assumption. Cox semi parametric model was used also to analyze the momentum and waiting time effect as non-Markov behavior. The result shows that first order Markov chain is powerful as a monitoring tool for Islamic banks. We find that waiting time negatively affected present rating downgrade (upgrade) significantly. Likewise, momentum covariate showed negative effect. Finally, the result confirms that different origin ratings have different movement behavior. The paper explores the potential of Markov chain framework as a risk management tool for Islamic banks. It provides valuable insight and integrative model for banks to manage their borrower accounts. This model can be developed to be a powerful early warning system to identify which borrower needs to be monitored intensively. Ultimately, this model could potentially increase the efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of Islamic banks in Indonesia. The analysis used only rating data. Further study should be able to give additional information about the determinant factors of rating movement of the borrowers by incorporating various factors such as contract-related factors, bank-related factors, borrower-related factors and macroeconomic factors.",Default risk | Islamic banking | Markov model | Profit-loss sharing | Survival rate,3,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This arises when a population of individuals behave independently according to a Markov chain, but individual sample paths cannot be observed due to limitations of the observation process or the need to protect privacy. Instead, only population-level counts of the number of individuals in each state at each time step are available. When these counts are exact, a conditional least squares (CLS) estimator is known to be consistent and asymptotically normal. We initiate the study of method of moments estimators for this problem to handle the more realistic case when observations are additionally corrupted by noise. We show that CLS can be interpreted as a simple “plug-in” method of moments estimator. However, when observations are noisy, it is not consistent because it fails to account for additional variance introduced by the noise. We develop a new, simpler method of moments estimator that bypasses this problem and is consistent under noisy observations.",,6,0,,,,undefined,

In finance, for instance, one could identify the background process with the ‘state of the economy’, to which asset prices react, or as an identification of the varying default rate of an obligor. The key feature of the counting processes in this paper is that their intensity processes are functions of a finite state Markov chain. This kind of processes can be used to model default events of some companies. Many quantities of interest in this paper, like conditional characteristic functions, can all be derived from conditional probabilities, which can, in principle, be analytically computed. We will also study limit results for models with rapid switching, which occur when inflating the intensity matrix of the Markov chain by a factor tending to infinity.

Via an alternative representation of AVaR, we reduce the problem of minimizing the AVaR of the finite horizon cost to two subproblems: one is to minimize the expected-positive-deviation of the finite horizon cost from some level over policies, which itself is a new and interesting problem in the finite horizon SMDP setting; the second is an ordinary problem of minimizing a function of a single variable. For the first subproblem, by the technique of extending the state space to include the cost level, we prove that the value function is a minimum solution to the optimality equation, and an optimal policy exists under suitable conditions. Furthermore, we show that the value function is the unique solution in a metric space to the optimality equation when one more condition is imposed, which plays a key role for the algorithm complexity analysis and the policy improvement algorithm. Based on the solution of the first subproblem, the existence and computation of an AVaR optimal policy are established by solving the second subproblem. To facilitate practical implementation of our results, we derive a value iteration algorithm and a policy improvement algorithm for computing an AVaR optimal policy.

In such situations, a more parsimonious, and therefore easier-to-grasp, model of a patient's disease progression can often be obtained by assuming that the future state transitions do not depend only on the present state (Markov assumption) but also on the past through time since entry in the present state. Despite that these so-called semi-Markov models are still relatively straightforward to specify and implement, they are not yet routinely applied in health economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions. To facilitate a better understanding of this type of model among applied health economic analysts, the first part of this article provides a detailed discussion of what the semi-Markov model entails and how such models can be specified in an intuitive way by adopting an approach called vertical modeling. In the second part of the article, we use this approach to construct a semi-Markov model for assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of 3 disease management programs for heart failure. Compared with a standard Markov model with the same disease states, our proposed semi-Markov model fitted the observed data much better. When subsequently extrapolating beyond the clinical trial period, these relatively large differences in goodness-of-fit translated into almost a doubling in mean total cost and a 60-d decrease in mean survival time when using the Markov model instead of the semi-Markov model. For the disease process considered in our case study, the semi-Markov model thus provided a sensible balance between model parsimoniousness and computational complexity.",continuous-time semi-Markov model | heart failure disease management | vertical modeling,15,0,repositoryam,Green,CTMM,01C-401,Center for Translational Molecular Medicine

The clustering of jumps gives rise to a time-varying optimal asset allocation: as jumps predict more jumps, the portfolio should be optimally rebalanced to hedge the risk of future jumps.

The disruption risk is continuously monitored via collaborative forecasting based on advance supply signals - such as financial health and operational viability. We first develop a Markov model to capture the nonstationary, volatile, and dynamic nature of the forecast evolution. We then integrate the forecast into a dynamic programming for inventory hedging under three hierarchies. We derive an easy-to-implement coordination contract and a simple policy structure that facilitates ex ante strategic planning and ex post dynamic execution. The optimal strategy is driven by properly balanced adaptiveness, resilience and intertemporal imperatives. It outperforms the conventional inventory hedging and lean management by reducing premature inventory holding in good times, and timely ramping up safety stock ahead of looming disruptions. The proposed subsidy contract can effectively address double marginalization and information concealment problems via risk sharing, power preserving, and Pareto improving. We show that dynamic forecast is valuable for high margin products, moderate fixed cost, and low demand volatility. Without coordination, mandating supply information sharing can exacerbate supply disruptions. The three instruments are strategic complements and most effective when deployed jointly.

First, a Chi-square test detects whether the transition probability distributions with and without collection differ significantly. Second, a regression and a t-test are used to assess the magnitude of the collection effect.

In order to have a realistic result we propose an iterated two-step method for solving the given portfolio constraint problem: (a) the first step is designed to optimize the nonlinear problem using a quadratic programming method for finding the long run fraction of the time that the system is in a given state (segment) and an action (promotion) is chosen and, (b) the second step is designed to find the optimal number of customers using a Lagrange programming approach. Both steps are based on the c-variable method to make the problem computationally tractable and obtain the optimal solution for the customer portfolio. The Tikhonov's regularization method is used to ensure the convergence of the objective-function to a single optimal portfolio solution. We prove that the proposed method converges by the Weierstrass theorem: the objective function of the mean-variance customer portfolio problem decreases, it is monotonically non-decreasing and bounded from above. In addition, for solving the customer portfolio problem we consider both, a constant risk-aversion restriction and budget limitations. The constraints imposed by the system produce mixed strategies.

Recently, an integrated importance measure (IIM) has been proposed to evaluate how the transition of component states affects the system performance based on the probability distributions and transition rates of component states. In the system operation phase, the bathtub curve presents the change of the transition rate of component states with time, which can be described by three different Weibull distributions. The behavior of a system under such distributions can be modeled by the semi-Markov process. So, based on the reported IIM equations of component states, this paper studies how the transition of component states affects system performance under the semi-Markov process. This measure can provide useful information for preventive actions (such as monitoring enhancement, construction improvement, etc.), and provide support to improve system performance.

The construction of the Google matrix allows to investigate the sensitivity of trade balance in respect to price variations of products, e.g. petroleum and gas, taking into account the world connectivity of trade links.

We extend the standard mixture cure model through: (1) relaxing the independence assumption of the probability and the time of default; (2) treating the missing defaulting labels as latent variables and applying an augmentation technique; and (3) introducing a discrete truncated exponential distribution to model the time of default. Our full model is written in a hierarchical form so that the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate corresponding parameters. Through an empirical analysis, we show that both mixture models, the standard mixture cure model and the hierarchical mixture cure model (HMCM), are more advanced in identifying future defaulters while compared with logistic regression.

We establish the large deviations principle for the empirical default rate for such an interacting particle system. The rate function is derived in an explicit form that is amenable to numerical computations and derivation of the most likely path to failure for the system itself. Numerical studies illustrate the theoretical findings. An understanding of the role of the preferred paths to large default rates and the most likely ways in which contagion and systematic risk combine to lead to large default rates would give useful insights into how to optimally safeguard against such events.,Default clustering | Heterogeneous networks | Large deviations | Large pools | Rare events,14,0,repositoryam,Green,,DMS 1312071,

The seven countries can be divided into those in which there is a high probability that leaders will be re-elected and those in which incumbents have relatively less success. A simple stochastic phenomenological dynamical model of electoral districts in which voters may be influenced by social neighbours, political parties and political leaders is then created to explore differences in voter behaviours in the countries. This model supports the thesis that an unsuccessful leader has a greater negative influence on individual voters than a successful leader, while also highlighting that increasing the influence on voters of social neighbours leads to a decrease in the average re-election rate of leaders, but raises the average amount of time the dominant party is in charge.© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It seeks to give a representative picture of the research topics most explored in recent years, highlight common themes in the investigations of independent research teams and highlight the contributions of rising as well as established researchers both to the theory of robust optimization and its practice. With respect to the theory of robust optimization, this paper reviews recent results on the cases without and with recourse, i.e., the static and dynamic settings, as well as the connection with stochastic optimization and risk theory, the concept of distributionally robust optimization, and findings in robust nonlinear optimization. With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., ""robustifying"" stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We model the evolution of the Market among its possible ν-states as an F-inhomogeneous semi-Markov process. This idea leads us to modeling the migration process of defaultable bonds as ν different F-inhomogeneous semi-Markov process. The survival probabilities of a defaultable bond in every credit grade are found. The asymptotic behaviour of the survival probabilities is established under certain conditions. Also, it is proved under what conditions the convergence is geometrically fast. The stochastic foundation of the general stochastic discrete-time Market is provided, by proving that the market is viable, if and only if, there exists an equivalent martingale measure, from which we construct the forward probability measure and under which the discounted default free bond price process for all possible states of the Market is a martingale. The term structure of credit spread and the change of real-world probability measure to forward probability measure are studied. In the form of a theorem it is proved that under certain conditions, changing the real probability measure to a forward probability measure, does not affect the inhomogeneous semi Markov process modeling the migration of defaultable bonds. That is, it is proved that it only changes the basic parameters and we provide a relation among the transition probabilities under the two measures. Finally, parameter estimation and calibration of the inhomogeneous semi-Markov chain in stochastic environment is being provided. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Asymptotic behaviour and estimation | Migration process in credit risk | Semi-Markov process | Survival probabilities,6,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

For this purpose, we adopt a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for an optimal decay factor for an exponential weighted moving average model, which is used to calculate the value at risk combined with risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC). We then propose a GA-based RAROC model. Next, using the model we find the optimal decay factor and investigate the performance and persistence of 31 Taiwanese open-end equity mutual funds over the period from November 2006 to October 2009, divided into three periods: November 2006-October 2007, November 2007-October 2008, and November 2008-October 2009, which includes the global financial crisis. We find that for three periods, the optimal decay factors are 0.999, 0.951, and 0.990, respectively. The rankings of funds between bull and bear markets are quite different.

The purpose of this article is to explore whether a Langevin equation extracted from real world data can generate synthetic time series with comparable LPPL structures. To this end, we first estimate the stochastic process underlying the DAX log-returns during the period from mid-1997 until end-2003. The employed data set contains about 3.93×106 intraday DAX quotes at a sampling rate of 15 s. Our results indicate that the DAX log-returns can be described as a Markov process. As a consequence, a Langevin equation is derived. Based on this model equation, we run extensive simulations in order to generate 100 synthetic DAX trajectories each covering 3000 trading days. We find LPPL behavior in ten artificial time series. Moreover, we can establish a link between LPPL patterns and ensuing bubble bursts in seven synthetic 600-week windows. However, the LPPL components in most synthetic trajectories differ fundamentally from those LPPL structures that have previously been detected in real financial time series. Summarized, this paper demonstrates that LPPL structures are not necessarily the signature of imitative behavior among investors but can also stem from noise, even though the likelihood of this is extremely low. Thus, our findings confirm with high statistical confidence that the LPPL structures in the DAX development are rooted deeper than only in the random fluctuations of the German stock market. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The authors provide an analytical basis for the quantitative methodology of dynamic valuation, mitigation, and hedging of bilateral counterparty risk on over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts under funding constraints. They explore credit, debt, funding, liquidity, and rating valuation adjustment (CVA, DVA, FVA, LVA, and RVA) as well as replacement cost (RC), wrong-way risk, multiple funding curves, and collateral. The first part of the book assesses today’s financial landscape, including the current multi-curve reality of financial markets. In mathematical but model-free terms, the second part describes all the basic elements of the pricing and hedging framework. Taking a more practical slant, the third part introduces a reduced-form modeling approach in which the risk of default of the two parties only shows up through their default intensities. The fourth part addresses counterparty risk on credit derivatives through dynamic copula models. In the fifth part, the authors present a credit migrations model that allows you to account for rating-dependent credit support annex (CSA) clauses. They also touch on nonlinear FVA computations in credit portfolio models. The final part covers classical tools from stochastic analysis and gives a brief introduction to the theory of Markov copulas. The credit crisis and ongoing European sovereign debt crisis have shown the importance of the proper assessment and management of counterparty risk. This book focuses on the interaction and possible overlap between DVA and FVA terms. It also explores the particularly challenging issue of counterparty risk in portfolio credit modeling. Primarily for researchers and graduate students in financial mathematics, the book is also suitable for financial quants, managers in banks, CVA desks, and members of supervisory bodies.",,46,0,,,,undefined,

Stability analysis is concerned with obtaining the set of all perturbations for which a solution to the integer optimization problem remains optimal. In particular, we derive expressions for stability regions for perturbations in the initial distribution, the transition matrix and the stationary distribution. The constraints that preserve the stochasticity of the problem data are affine. The intersection of the stability region for arbitrary perturbations with these affine constraints yields the desired stability regions. Finally, stability regions for perturbations of elements of the transition matrix, given that the problem is linear in the stationary distribution of that transition matrix, are obtained using a small perturbation analysis.

Easy-to-Use Techniques and Tools for Real-World Data Modeling The book first shows how the framework allows model representation for different data types, including continuous, categorical, count, and time-to-event data. This leads to the use of generic methods, such as the stochastic approximation of the EM algorithm (SAEM), for modeling these diverse data types.

Second, to handle uncertain interruptions in the execution of patrol schedules, MOPSS uses Markov decision processes (MDPs) in its scheduling. Third, MOPSS is the first system to account for joint activities between multiple resources, by employing the well known SMART security game model that tackles coordination between defender’s resources. Fourth, we are also the first to deploy a new Opportunistic Security Game model, where the adversary, a criminal, makes opportunistic decisions on when and where to commit crimes.

As result effectiveness, both methods solved all test problems resulting equal LADs each. The CG method required more average time.

The model focuses on the patient’s age as a relevant factor to forecast the transitions among the different levels of seriousness of the disease. A sample of 1456 patients was taken from a hospital record at Amhara Referral Hospitals, Amhara Region, Ethiopia, who were under ART follow up from June 2006 to August 2013. The states of disease progression adopted in the model were defined based on of the following CD4 cell counts: >500 cells/mm3 (SI); 349 to 500 cells/mm3 (SII); 199 to 350 cells/mm3(SIII); ≤200 cells/mm3 (SIV); and death (D). The first four states are referred as living states. The probability that an HIV/AIDS patient with any one of the living states will transition to the death state is greater with increasing age, irrespective of the current state and age of the patient. More generally, the probability of dying decreases with increasing CD4 counts over time. For an HIV/AIDS patient in a specific state of the disease, the probability of remaining in the same state decreases with increasing age. Within the living states, the results show that the probability of being in a better state is non-zero, but less than the probability of being in a worse state for all ages. A reliability analysis also revealed that the survival probabilities are all declining over time. Computed conditional probabilities show differential subject response that depends on the age of the patient. The dynamic nature of AIDS progression is confirmed with particular findings that patients are more likely to be in a worse state than a better one unless interventions are made.

However, existing SSGs models yield fixed, static, schedules which fail in dynamic domains where defenders face execution uncertainty, i.e., in domains where defenders may face unanticipated disruptions of their schedules. A concrete example is an application involving checking fares on trains, where a defender's schedule is frequently interrupted by fare evaders, making static schedules useless. To address this shortcoming, this paper provides four main contributions. First, we present a novel general Bayesian Stackelberg game model for security resource allocation in dynamic uncertain domains. In this new model, execution uncertainty is handled by using a Markov decision process (MDP) for generating defender policies. Second, we study the problem of computing a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game and exploit problem structure to reduce it to a polynomial-sized optimization problem. Shifting to evaluation, our third contribution shows, in simulation, that our MDP-based policies overcome the failures of previous SSG algorithms. In so doing, we can now build a complete system, that enables handling of schedule interruptions and, consequently, to conduct some of the first controlled experiments on SSGs in the field. Hence, as our final contribution, we present results from a real-world experiment on Metro trains in Los Angeles validating our MDPbased model, and most importantly, concretely measuring the benefits of SSGs for security resource allocation. © 2014 AI Access Foundation.

Motivated by these findings, we propose a unified credit-equity model by extending the latent structural model in Kijima et al. (2009). As in the original latent model, we treat the actual status of the firm to be unobservable and one can extract information from the marker process that is observable to the investors. Default occurs when the actual firm value drops below a default threshold for the first time. Different from the model in Kijima et al. (2009), however, we define the marker process to be the firm's equity process. Choosing firm's equity process to be a marker process subsequently relaxes the restrictions imposed in Kijima et al. (2009), enabling us to price firm-related securities. Additionally, we enrich the original latent structural model with jump and regime-switching dynamics. The purpose of the extensions is to capture more realistic credit spreads and implied volatility skews under different economic environments. The proposed model maintains analytical tractability even under such complex dynamics, for the prices of CDSs and equity options admit semi-closed-form solutions.

It is observed that there are two separate put call parity relations in place, with the ask price for call less bid prices for put delivering an ask price for the forward-stock. Likewise the ask for puts less the bid for calls identifies the bid for the forward-stock. Two processes are introduced to determine bid and ask prices for claims comonotone with a long or short position in the stock. For a claim comonotone with a long position one uses the so-called increasing process for the ask price and the so-called decreasing process for the bid price and vice versa for a claim comonotone with a short position. As candidates for the two processes one may employ any of the traditional one-dimensional Markov processes. We illustrate the theory by using a Sato process, a model known to produce a smile conforming fit over strike and maturity. The two processes are observed to have marginals related by first order stochastic dominance. The increasing process dominates the decreasing process in this sense. These two processes are also used to construct upper and lower bounds for bid and ask prices for claims not comonotone with a long or short stock position.

In the second step, the efficient importance sampling technique of Richard and Zhang (2007) is used to integrate out the latent states, thereby yielding the likelihood function. Using both simulated and real data, we show that the proposed ML method works better than alternative methods.

Essentially there are three approaches in use. These are Monte Carlo, Fourier transform and partial integro-differential equation (PIDE)-based methods. We focus our attention here on the latter. There is a large arsenal of numerical methods for efficiently solving parabolic equations that arise in this context. Especially Galerkin and Galerkin-inspired methods have an impressive potential. In order to apply these methods, what is required is a formulation of the equation in the weak sense. The contribution of this paper is therefore to analyse weak solutions of the Kolmogorov backward equations which are related to prices of European options in (time-inhomogeneous) Lévy models and to establish a precise link between the prices and the weak solutions of these equations. The resulting relation is a Feynman-Kac representation of the solution as a conditional expectation. Our special concern is to provide a framework that is able to cover both, the common types of European options and a wide range of advanced models in which these derivatives are priced. An application to financial models requires in particular to admit pure jump processes such as generalized hyperbolic processes as well as unbounded domains of the equation. In order to deal at the same time with the typical pay-offs that can arise, the weak formulation of the equation is based on exponentially weighted Sobolev-Slobodeckii spaces. We provide a number of examples of models that are covered by this general framework. Examples of options for which such an analysis is required are calls, puts, digital and power options as well as basket options.",Lévy processes | Option pricing | Parabolic evolution equation | PIDEs | Sobolev-slobodeckii-spaces | Wavelet-galerkin method | Weak solutions,15,0,,,DFG,EB66/11-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Instead, we study utility based prices under two scenarios of resolution of uncertainty for event risk: when the event is continuously monitored, or when it is revealed only at the payment date. In both cases, we transform the incomplete market optimal portfolio choice problem of an agent endowed with an ESCC into a complete market problem with a state and possibly path-dependent utility function. For negative exponential utility, we obtain an explicit representation of the utility based prices under both information resolution scenarios and this in turn leads us to a simple characterization of the early resolution premium.

On the applied side, various issues related to the numerical implementation of the method are considered; in particular, we propose working with a subspace that is constructed from a basis of Hermite polynomials. The paper closes with a numerical case study. © 2013 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",Galerkin approximation | Hermite polynomials | Point processes | Stochastic filtering | Zakai equation,11,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Along the way, the resulting specialized Monte Carlo solutions are discussed in the context of how they complemented alternative approaches adopted in risk management, including closed form bounds and asymptotic results for functionals of tails of risk processes. The development of the article starts from the premise that whilst interacting particle methods are increasingly used to sample from complex and high-dimensional distributions, they have yet to be generally adopted in inferential problems in risk and insurance. Therefore, we introduce a range of methods which can all be interpreted in the general framework of interacting particle methods, which goes well beyond the standard particle filtering framework and Sequential Monte Carlo frameworks. For the applications we consider in risk and insurance we focus on particular classes of interacting particle genetic type algorithms. These stochastic particle integration techniques can be interpreted as a universal acceptance-rejection sequential particle sampler equipped with adaptive and interacting recycling mechanisms. We detail how one may reinterpret these stochastic particle integration techniques under a Feynman-Kac particle integration framework. In the process, we illustrate how such frameworks act as natural mathematical extensions of the traditional change of probability measures, common in designing importance samplers for risk managements applications.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

This new dividend valuation model assumes that the dividend growth rate follows a finite state discrete time semi-Markov chain. An important consequence is that prices become duration dependent, i.e. they are influenced not only by the current state of the dividend growth process but also by the elapsed time in this state. This general valuation setting necessitates a more complex solution procedure with respect to the Markovian models. In fact, the valuation procedure of the semi-Markov model requires the solution of a system of first order linear difference equations with variable coefficients. The model is implemented by using experimental data freely available at http://www.econ.yale.edu/shiller/data.htm. The parameters of the model are estimated and the data strongly support the semi-Markov hypothesis of the dividend growth rate process.

The book is split into three parts. The first part considers financial markets in general and looks at the complex models needed to handle observed structures, reviewing models based on diffusions including stochastic-local volatility models and (pure) jump processes. It shows the possible risk neutral densities, implied volatility surfaces, option pricing and typical paths for a variety of models including SABR, Heston, Bates, Bates-Hull-White, Displaced-Heston, or stochastic volatility versions of Variance Gamma, respectively Normal Inverse Gaussian models and finally, multi-dimensional models.

The second part of the book deals with numerical methods which enables the reader to use the models of the first part for pricing and risk management, covering methods based on direct integration and Fourier transforms, and detailing the implementation of the COS, CONV, Carr-Madan method or Fourier-Space-Time Stepping. This is applied to pricing of European, Bermudan and exotic options as well as the calculation of the Greeks.

The interplay between stochastic theory of NHMS and NHSMS and other branches of probability, stochastic processes and mathematics, we believe is a fascinating one apart from being important. In many cases the information needed for the evolution of a NHMS is a larger set than the history of the multidimensional process NHMS. In our world where an overflow of information exists almost in all problems, it is almost surely that this will be available. Here, we extend the definition of the NHMS in order to accomodate this case. In this respect we arrive at the defnition of the G-non homogeneous Markov system. We study the problem of change of measure in a G-non homogeneousMarkov system. It is proved that under certain conditions the NHMS retains the Markov property, while as expected the basic sequences of transition probabilities change and it is established how they do so. We also find the expected population structure of the NHMS under the new measure in close analytic form. We also define the G-non homogeneous semi-Markov system and we study the problem of change of measure in a G-non homogeneous semi-Markov system. It is proved that under certain conditions the NHSMS retains the semi-Markov property while as expected the basic sequences of transition probabilities change and it is established how they do so. We prove that if the input process of memberships is a non homogeneous Poisson process, then asymtotically and under certain easily met in practice conditions, the compensated population structure of the G-NHMS is a martingale. Finally we prove that the space of all random population structures, under easily met in practice conditions, is a Hilbert space.

We model the evolution of credit migration of a defaultable bond as an inhomogeneous semi-Markov process with fuzzy states. We study the effects of changing the real probability measure to a forward probability measure. In addition, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the survival probability in each fuzzy state given in the absence of default.

Problems in which the bound to be traversed is itself a fluctuating function of time include widely studied problems in neural coding, such as neuronal integrators with irregular inputs and internal noise. We show that the probability p(t) that a Gauss-Markov process will first exceed the boundary at time t suffers a phase transition as a function of the roughness of the boundary, as measured by its Hölder exponent H. The critical value occurs when the roughness of the boundary equals the roughness of the process, so for diffusive processes the critical value is Hc = 1/2. For smoother boundaries, H > 1/2, the probability density is a continuous function of time. For rougher boundaries, H < 1/2, the probability is concentrated on a Cantor-like set of zero measure: the probability density becomes divergent, almost everywhere either zero or infinity. The critical point Hc = 1/2 corresponds to a widely studied case in the theory of neural coding, in which the external input integrated by a model neuron is a white-noise process, as in the case of uncorrelated but precisely balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We argue that this transition corresponds to a sharp boundary between rate codes, in which the neural firing probability varies smoothly, and temporal codes, in which the neuron fires at sharply defined times regardless of the intensity of internal noise.",,28,1,repositoryam,Green,NSF,0928723,National Science Foundation

These two volumes aim to provide a foundation course on applied stochastic finance. They are designed for three groups of readers: firstly, students of various backgrounds seeking a core knowledge on the subject of stochastic finance; secondly financial analysts and practitioners in the investment, banking and insurance industries; and finally other professionals who are interested in learning advanced mathematical and stochastic methods, which are basic knowledge in many areas, through finance. Volume 1 starts with the introduction of the basic financial instruments and the fundamental principles of financial modeling and arbitrage valuation of derivatives. Next, we use the discrete-time binomial model to introduce all relevant concepts. The mathematical simplicity of the binomial model also provides us with the opportunity to introduce and discuss in depth concepts such as conditional expectations and martingales in discrete time. However, we do not expand beyond the needs of the stochastic finance framework. Numerous examples, each highlighted and isolated from the text for easy reference and identification, are included.

Only a basic knowledge of probability, real analysis, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra and some common sense are required to understand the concepts considered in this book. Financial mathematics is an application of advanced mathematical and statistical methods to financial management and markets, with a main objective of quantifying and hedging risks. Since the book aims to present the basics of financial mathematics to the reader, only essential elements of probability and stochastic analysis are given to explain ideas concerning derivative pricing and hedging. To keep the reader intrigued and motivated, the book has a ‘sandwich’ structure: Probability and stochastics are given in situ where mathematics can be readily illustrated by application to finance. The first part of the book introduces one of the main principles in finance — ‘no arbitrage pricing’. It also introduces main financial instruments such as forward and futures contracts, bonds and swaps, and options. The second part deals with pricing and hedging of European- and American-type options in the discrete-time setting. In addition, the concept of complete and incomplete markets is discussed. Elementary probability is briefly revised and discrete-time discrete-space stochastic processes used in financial modelling are considered. The third part introduces the Wiener process, Ito integrals and stochastic differential equations, but its main focus is the famous Black–Scholes formula for pricing European options. Some guidance for further study within this exciting and rapidly changing field is given in the concluding chapter. There are approximately 100 exercises interspersed throughout the book, and solutions for most problems are provided in the appendices.",,2,0,,,,undefined,

The surplus of the insurance company is governed by the Brownian motion with a constant drift and a diffusion term. The company can manage its risk exposure simultaneously through proportional reinsurance. Apart from the proportional reinsurance, the insurance company also pays out dividends with bounded dividends rate. With the help of the stochastic dynamic programming approach, we solve the control problem of maximizing the expectation of discounted dividends and the terminal value.

An accurate estimation of credit risk helps organizations to decide whether or not to grant credit to potential customers. Many classification methods have been suggested to handle this problem in the literature. This paper proposes a model for evaluating credit risk based on binary quantile regression, using Bayesian estimation. This paper points out the distinct advantages of the latter approach: that is (i) the method provides accurate predictions of which customers may default in the future, (ii) the approach provides detailed insight into the effects of the explanatory variables on the probability of default, and (iii) the methodology is ideally suited to build a segmentation scheme of the customers in terms of risk of default and the corresponding uncertainty about the prediction. An often studied dataset from a German bank is used to show the applicability of the method proposed.

Maintaining the currency of discovered knowledge over evolving data sources is a fundamental challenge faced by all KDD applications. This paper addresses the challenge from the perspective of deciding the right times to refresh knowledge. We define the knowledge-refreshing problem and model it as a Markov decision process. Based on the identified properties of the Markov decision process model, we establish that the optimal knowledge-refreshing policy is monotonically increasing in the system state within every appropriate partition of the state space. We further show that the problem of searching for the optimal knowledgerefreshing policy can be reduced to the problem of finding the optimal thresholds and propose a method for computing the optimal knowledge-refreshing policy. The effectiveness and the robustness of the computed optimal knowledge-refreshing policy are examined through extensive empirical studies addressing a real-world knowledge-refreshing problem. Our method can be applied to refresh knowledge for KDD applications that employ major data-mining models. © 2013 INFORMS.",Data mining | Knowledge discovery in databases | Knowledge refreshing | Markov decision process,18,0,,,,undefined,

We formalize the problem in terms of minimization of relative entropy with respect to the prior under calibration constraints and use convex duality methods to solve the problem: the dual problem is shown to be an intensity control problem, characterized in terms of a Hamilton-Jacobi system of differential equations, for which we present an analytical solution. Given a set of observed CDO tranche spreads, our method allows to construct a default intensity process which leads to tranche spreads consistent with the observations.

In this study, we briefly review three popular artificial intelligence methods, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization, and compare their applications in financial domain. By considering the broad domain of financial applications, we classify financial market into three domains, including financial forecasting, credit evaluation, and portfolio management. For each technique, we have attempted to take the most recent and popular studies into account. The results are promising and represent that in handling financial problems, the performance and accuracy of the above mentioned artificial intelligence techniques are considerably higher, compared to the traditional statistical techniques, particularly in nonlinear models.

Based on the existing pricing models and specific provisions of convertible bonds, this paper puts forward a bond-option model, and further illustrates this pricing model in theoretical and numerical ways respectively.

We stand in the gray zone between mathematical finance and financial econometrics, between academic and market practitioners' approaches. We chose to first present two scholar models, each of them leading to perfect replication of CDO tranches with credit default swaps (CDSs). Though they rely on rather simplistic assumptions and are built upon different premises, they lead to similar hedge ratios. We also stress that the study of the hedging issue in these two approaches involves the same basic theoretical ingredients. We then discuss various problems related to the use of such models in designing hedging strategies for CDO tranches and back-testing or assessing hedging performance. At this stage, it appears that model-based hedging strategies do help in the risk management process. Even though correlation markets had to face serious tests, more data related to shortterm-maturity equity tranche spreads and plain CDSs are required to discriminate against competing modeling approaches. © 2011 by Tomasz R.

We consider a set of continuous-time processes that describe the flow of information concerning market factors in a monetary economy. The nominal pricing kernel is assumed to be given at any specified time by a function of the values of information processes at that time. Using a change-of-measure technique, we derive explicit expressions for the prices of nominal discount bonds and deduce the associated dynamics of the short rate of interest and the market price of risk. The interest rate positivity condition is expressed as a differential inequality. An example that shows how the model can be calibrated to an arbitrary initial yield curve is presented. We proceed to model the price level, which is also taken at any specified time to be given by a function of the values of the information processes at that time. A simple model for a stochastic monetary economy is introduced in which the prices of the nominal discount bonds and inflation-linked notes can be expressed in terms of aggregate consumption and the liquidity benefit generated by the money supply. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",fixed-income securities | incomplete information | inflation-linked securities | interest rate theory | non-linear filtering,10,0,repositoryam,Green,ACP,undefined,Aspen Center for Physics

We also explore applications of the proposed model to the valuation of mortality-linked securities. A general valuation framework for valuing mortality-linked products is presented for this model. With a proposed risk loading mechanism, we can make an easy transition from the physical measure to a risk-neutral measure and hence is able to calibrate the model to market information.

We then establish an existence result to characterize the truncation error and provide explicit joint density formulas for the first three orders. Our approach inherits the same spirit of a small total volatility-of-volatility assumption as in the original SABR analysis.

We study international diversification with two dependence measures: correlations and extreme dependence. We discover that dependence has typically increased over time, and document mixed evidence on heavy tails in individual countries. Moreover, we uncover three additional findings related to dependence. First, the timing of downside risk differs depending on the region. Surprisingly, recent Latin American returns exhibit little downside risk. Second, Latin America exhibits a great deal of correlation complexity. Third, according to the empirical results, correlation does not vary with returns, but extreme dependence does vary monotonically with regional returns. Our results are consistent with a tradeoff between international diversification and systemic risk. They also suggest international limits to diversification, and that international investors demand some compensation for joint downside risk during extreme events. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Correlation complexity | Diversification | Downside Risk | Extreme value | Systemic risk,14,0,,,NSF,-02–05791,National Science Foundation

The proposed test is applicable to both univariate and multivariate time series with discrete or continuous distributions.

The simulation-based methods have proven to be particularly useful when the likelihood function and moments do not have tractable forms and hence the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the generalized method of moments (GMM) are difficult to use. They are also useful for improving the finite sample performance of the traditional methods. Both frequentist and Bayesian simulationbased methods are reviewed. Frequentist’s simulation-based methods cover various forms of simulated maximum likelihood (SML) methods, simulated generalized method of moments (SGMM), efficient method of moments (EMM), and indirect inference (II) methods. Bayesian simulation-based methods cover various MCMC algorithms. Each simulation-based method is discussed in the context of a specific financial time series model as a motivating example. Empirical applications, based on real exchange rates, interest rates and equity data, illustrate how to implement the simulation-based methods. In particular, we apply SML to a discrete time stochastic volatility model, EMM to estimate a continuous time stochastic volatility model, MCMC to a credit risk model, the II method to a term structure model.",,3,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Traditional studies of customer switching always assume that customers are homogeneous, and thus that model customer switching behavior follows a Markov formulation. However, this postulation is obviously inappropriate in most instances. Blumen et al. (Cornell Studies of Industrial and Labor Relations, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY, 1955) developed the Mover-Stayer (MS) model, a generalization of the Markov chain model, to relax the requirement of homogeneity and allow the presence of heterogeneity with two different types of individualsâ""stayers,"" who purchase the same kinds of products or services throughout the entire observation period; and ""movers,"" who look for variety in products or services over time. There are two purpose of this article. First, we extend the MS model to a Double Mover-Stayer (DMS) model by assuming the existence of three types of individuals in the market: (1) stable and loyal customers, who have stable usage within the same company; (2) instable but loyal customers, whose usage varies within the same company over time; and (3) disloyal customers, who switch from one company to another to seek for new experiences or/and benefits. We also propose an estimation method for the DMS model. Second, we apply the DMS model to telecommunications data and demonstrate how it can be used for pattern identification, hidden knowledge discovery, and decision making. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Traditionally, data consist in sequences of observed states for a given number of individuals over the whole observation period. In such a case, the estimation of transition probabilities is straightforwardly made by counting one-step moves from a given state to another. In many real-life problems, however, the inference is much more difficult as state sequences are not fully observed, namely the state of each individual is known only for some given values of the time variable. A review of the problem is given, focusing on Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms to perform Bayesian inference and evaluate posterior distributions of the transition probabilities in this missing-data framework. Leaning on the dependence between the rows of the transition matrix, an adaptive MCMC mechanism accelerating the classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is then proposed and empirically studied. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Supervisors receive reports on proportions of performing and non-performing aggregate loan classes of individual banks-corporate, mortgage and consumer-often with very short history. The transition to different proportions of aggregate credit qualities can be seen as a Markov process and Christodoulakis [J. Credit Risk, 2007, 3(3), 25-39] proposed a simulation-based method for the estimation of transition probabilities under non-negativity constraints, based on the work of Kloek and van Dijk [Econometrica, 1978, 46(1), 1-19] and van Dijk and Kloek [J. Econometrics, 1980, 14, 307-328]. This paper provides Monte Carlo robustness checks for the performance of this estimator in comparison to Least Squares and Restricted Least Squares (OLS-R) in the presence of ultra-small samples. When true transition probabilities are very large or very small, the least squares estimators severely violate nonnegativity restrictions, leading to a spuriously small bias as compared to Monte Carlo integration (MCI). This result is intensified for low volatility regimes and small samples. The bias of MCI diminishes in higher volatility regimes and larger samples, irrespective of the number of Bayesian replications. Regarding the accuracy statistics, we observe that the variance of every estimator increases in smaller samples and lower volatility regimes. MCI is revealed as more accurate or at least equivalent to OLS-R in all cases. Our empirical applications with real US and European data on aggregate credit portfolios revealed significant violations of non-negativity constraints by least squares methods, which contribute to favourable conclusions for MCI. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Credit risk | Markov process | Non-performing credit | Probability | Transition,0,0,,,,undefined,

In general, portfolio credit derivatives are subject to two kinds of risk, a default event risk, when any underlying firm involved in the CDO fails to fulfill its obligations, and credit spread risk, due to the change of the default intensity over time. In dealing with either type of risk, it is absolutely necessary to develop a dynamic model incorporating the stochastic behavior of the macro-economic conditions and their influence on the default intensity. In this paper, a dynamic stochastic model is developed where the macro-economic conditions are assumed to follow a birth-death process, which would affect loss distributions characterized by a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). By exploiting the stochastic structure of the MMPP, efficient computational procedures are established for evaluating time-dependent loss distributions and prices of the CDO.

This extends to time-stationarity. Simulations contrast the asymptotic results with finite samples. An application to a sufficiently large set of credit rating histories shows that the one-parameter model can be a good starting point. © 2011 The Korean Statistical Society.",Counting process | Likelihood ratio | Metric | Multiple Markov process | Rating,9,0,,,DFG,SFB 823,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Using this result, we then derive the implied volatility in the large-time limit in the new regime, and we find that the large-time smile mimics the large-time smile for the Barndorff-Nielsen normal inverse Gaussian model. This makes precise the sense in which the Heston model tends to an exponential Lévy process for large times. We find that the implied volatility smile does not flatten out as the maturity increases, but rather it spreads out, and the large-time, large-moneyness regime is needed to capture this effect. As a special case, we provide a rigorous proof of the well-known result by Lewis (Option Valuation Under Stochastic Volatility, Finance Press, Newport Beach, 2000) for the implied volatility in the usual large-time, fixed-strike regime, at leading order. We find that there are two critical strike values where there is a qualitative change of behaviour for the call option price, and we use a limiting argument to compute the asymptotic implied volatility in these two cases. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Asymptotics | Heston | Implied volatility | Large deviations,33,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this paper, we outline a framework for gauging the effects of credit migration on portfolio risk measurements. For a typical loan portfolio, we find credit migration can explain as much as 51% of volatility and 35% of economic capital. We compare through-the-cycle migration effects, implied by agency rating transitions, with point-in-time migration, implied by EDF™ (Expected Default Frequency) transitions, and find that migration of point-in-time credit quality accounts for a greater fraction of total portfolio risk when compared with through-the-cycle dynamics. In a stylized analytic setting, we show that, when controlling for PD term structure effects, higher likelihood of moving away from the current credit state does not necessarily imply greater risk. Finally, we review methods for generating high-frequency transition matrices, needed for analyzing instruments with cash flows or contingencies whose frequencies are asynchronous to an available transition matrix. We further demonstrate that the naïve application of such methods can result in material deviations to portfolio analytics. © 2011 Moody's Investors Service Inc. and/or its affiliates.",Credit migration | Credit portfolio management | Credit risk | Markov model | Transition matrix,11,0,,,,undefined,

The first factor represents the macro economic condition which would affect the default intensities of the two industrial sectors differently. The second factor reflects the influences of the past defaults of corporations against other active corporations, where such influences would affect the two industrial sectors differently. A two-layer Markov chain model is developed, where the macro economic condition is described as a birth-death process, while another Markov chain represents the stochastic characteristics of defaults with default intensities dependent on the state of the birth-death process and the number of defaults in two sectors. Although the state space of the two-layer Markov chain is huge, the fundamental absorbing process with a reasonable state space size could capture the first passage time structure of the two-layer Markov chain, thereby enabling one to evaluate the joint probability of the number of defaults in two sectors via the uniformization procedure of Keilson.

Managers' financing choices as well as their dynamic equity stakes, which trade off their private benefits and the costs they incur due to their lack of diversification, are simultaneously and endogenously determined. Our analysis leads to the novel, empirically testable implications that leverage increases with the drift or expected growth rate of the firm's earnings. Debt maturity varies non-monotonically in a U-shaped manner with the project's drift and with its volatility. The predicted variations of leverage and debt maturity with the actual drift of earnings (controlling for the risk-neutral drift) are key implications of our theory that arise from the incorporation of agency conflicts between undiversified managers and well-diversified outside investors. They cannot, therefore, be obtained in traditional capital structure models in which all agents are well-diversified. Our predictions for the variation of leverage and debt maturity with project characteristics potentially reconcile empirical findings that are not consistent with previous theories. We also derive additional novel implications that link manager-specific characteristics - the discount rate or ""degree of myopia"" and the risk aversion - to leverage and debt maturity.

In this paper, a systematic way is presented to estimate the first order (one step) Markov chain transition matrix from wind speed time series by two steps. Wind speed time series data is used first to generate basic estimators of transition matrices (i.e. first order, second order, third order, etc.) based on counting techniques. Then an evolutionary algorithm (EA), specifically double-objective evolutionary strategy algorithm (ES), is proposed to search for the first order Markov chain transition matrix which can best match these basic estimators after transforming the first order transition matrix into its higher order counterparts. The evolutionary search for the first order transition matrix is guided by a predefined cost function which measures the difference between the basic estimators and the first order transition matrix, and its high order transformations. To deal with the potential high dimensional optimization problem (i.e. large transition matrices), an enhanced offspring generation procedure is proposed to help the ES algorithm converge efficiently and find better Pareto frontiers through generations. The proposed method is illustrated with wind speed time series data collected from individual 1.5 MW wind turbines at different time scales. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Data mining | Evolutionary algorithms | Markov chain | Optimization | Wind power | Wind speed time series,36,0,,,NSFC,2007AA05Z445,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In this paper, we consider the Bayesian approach by applying Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in estimating default probability and asset correlation under serially dependent factor model.

Bayes and empirical Bayes estimators are derived where the population is divided into segments or subpopulations whose transition matrices differ in some, but not all entries. Loan-level models for key transition matrix entries can be constructed where loan-level covariates capture the non-stationarity of the transition matrix.

To develop the utility measures for multi-state systems, we assume that the degradation of the multi-state systems follows a non-homogeneous semi-Markov process together with a backward recurrence time process and that the system can directly degrade into any lower state. The measure considers the immediate utility derived from the state of the system occupancy and the utility due to the system survival expectations derived from its reliability. Moreover, in order to measure the customer's cumulative utility, the discounted non-homogeneous continuous time semi-Markov process with rewards is implemented. In such a way, the higher order moments of the reward process can be evaluated and then, in particular, the expectation and the standard deviation of the consumer's accumulated discounted utility. These statistic indices are useful both to the industry in order to compare different system designs offered by the market and to the market itself, in order to know the customer's utility deriving from the goods she/he consumes.

Then, the FF model is extended to a model with a Markov regime switching mechanism for bull, bear, and transition market regimes. Findings – It is found that all market regimes are persistent, with the bull market regime being the most persistent, and the bear market regime being the least persistent. Both the risk premiums of the Sector Select ETFs and their sensitivities to the risk factors are highly regime dependent. Research limitations/implications – The regime-switching model has a superior performance in capturing the risk sensitivities of the Sector Select ETFs, that would otherwise be missed by both the FF and the augmented FF models.

This study presents an approach to large-scale portfolio optimization problems using GRA with a new operator, called guided mutation. In order to pick up the most efficient portfolio, GRA considers the correlation coefficient between stock brands as strength, which indicates the relation between nodes in each individual of GRA. Guided mutation generates offspring according to the average value of correlation coefficients in each individual, which means to enhance the exploitation ability of evolution of GRA.

Non repayment of such credits cause many problems to the banks such as incapability to repay the central bank's loans, increasing the amount of credit allocations comparing to credit repayment and incapability to allocate more credits to customers. The importance of credit allocation in banking industry and it's important role in economic growth and employment creation leads the development of many models to evaluate the credit risk of applicants. But many of these models are classic and are incapable to do credit evaluation completely and efficiently. Therefore the demand to use artificial intelligence in this field has grown up. In this paper after providing appropriate credit ranking model and collecting expert's knowledge, we design a hybrid intelligent system for credit ranking using reasoning-transformational models. Expert system as symbolic module and artificial neural network as non-symbolic module are components of this hybrid system. Such models provide the unique features of each components, the reasoning and explanation of expert system and the generalization and adaptability of artificial neural networks.

It is discussed how to complete markets based upon stochastic volatility models via trading in both stocks and vanilla options. Exponential utility indifference pricing is explored via a duality with entropy minimization. Backward stochastic differential equations offer an alternative approach and are moreover applied to study markets with trading constraints including basis risk. A range of optimal martingale measures are discussed including the entropy, Esscher and minimal martingale measures.

For instance, the real-business-cycle research program originated with an investigation of the consequences of changes in productivity (Kydland and Prescott 1982). Later, the new generation of monetary models of the late 1990s and early 2000s was particularly focused on shocks to monetary policy (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 2005). In open macroeconomics, considerable attention was devoted to shocks to the interest rate (Mendoza 1991) or to the terms of trade (Mendoza 1995). Similar examples can be cited from dozens of other subfields of macroeconomics, from asset pricing to macro public finance: Researchers postulate an exogenous stochastic process and explore the consequences for prices and quantities of innovations to it. Traditionally, one key feature of these stochastic processes was the assumption of homoscedasticity. More recently, however, economists started to relax this assumption. In particular, they considered shocks to the variance of the innovations of the processes. A first motivation for this new research comes from the realization that time-series have a strong time-varying variance component. The most famous of those episodes is the great moderation of aggregate fluctuations in the United States between 1984 and 2007, when real aggregate volatility fell by around one third and nominal volatility by more than half. A natural mechanism to generate these changes is to have shocks that also have a time-varying volatility and to trace the effects of changes in volatility on aggregate dynamics.",,20,0,,,,undefined,

These equations are motivated by numerous applications in financial modeling, whence the title of the paper. This financial motivation is developed in the first part of the paper, which provides a synthetic view of the theory of pricing and hedging financial derivatives, using backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) as main tool. In the second part of the paper, we establish the well-posedness of reflected BSDEs with jumps coming out of the pricing and hedging problems exposed in the first part. We first provide a construction of a Markovian model made of a jump-diffusion - like component X interacting with a continuous-time Markov chain - like component N. The jump process N defines the so-called regime of the coefficients of X, whence the name of jump-diffusion with regimes for this model. Motivated by optimal stopping and optimal stopping game problems (pricing equations of American or game contingent claims), we introduce the related reflected and doubly reflected Markovian BSDEs, showing that they are well-posed in the sense that they have unique solutions, which depend continuously on their input data. As an aside, we establish the Markov property of the model. In the third part of the paper we derive the related variational inequality approach. We first introduce the systems of partial integro-differential variational inequalities formally associated to the reflected BSDEs, and we state suitable definitions of viscosity solutions for these problems, accounting for jumps and/or systems of equations. We then show that the state-processes (first components Y ) of the solutions to the reflected BSDEs can be characterized in terms of the value functions of related optimal stopping or game problems, given as viscosity solutions with polynomial growth to related integro-differential obstacle problems. We further establish a comparison principle for semi-continuous viscosity solutions to these problems, which implies in particular the uniqueness of the viscosity solutions. This comparison principle is subsequently used for proving the convergence of stable, monotone and consistent approximation schemes to the value functions. Finally in the last part of the paper we provide various extensions of the results needed for applications in finance to pricing problems involving discrete dividends on a financial derivative or on the underlying asset, as well as various forms of discrete path-dependence.",,20,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of cooperative particle swarm optimization and cultural algorithm. It is thus called cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (CCPSO). The proposed CCPSO method, which uses cooperative behavior among multiple swarms, can increase the global search capacity using the belief space. Cooperative behavior involves a collection of multiple swarms that interact by exchanging information to solve a problem. The belief space is the information repository in which the individuals can store their experiences such that other individuals can learn from them indirectly. The proposed FLNFN model uses functional link neural networks as the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. This chapter uses orthogonal polynomials and linearly independent functions in a functional expansion of the functional link neural networks. The FLNFN model can generate the consequent part of a nonlinear combination of input variables. Finally, the proposed functional-link-based neural fuzzy network with cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (FLNFN-CCPSO) is adopted in several predictive applications. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed CCPSO method performs well in predicting the time series problems. © 2010, IGI Global.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

An analytical model is formulated with a view to solving an optimal stochastic production problem of the system with machines having up-downtime non-exponential distributions. The model developed is obtained by using a dynamic programming approach and a semi-Markov process. The control problem aims to find the production rates needed by the machines to meet the demand rate, through a minimization of the inventory/shortage cost. Using the Bellman principle, the optimality conditions obtained satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman equation, which depends on time and system states, and ultimately, leads to a feedback control. Consequently, the new model enables us to improve the coefficient of variation (CVup/down) to be less than one while it is equal to one in Markov model. Heuristics methods are used to involve the problem because of the difficulty of the analytical model using several states, and to show what control law should be used in each system state (i.e., including Kanban, feedback and CONWIP control). Numerical methods are used to solve the optimality conditions and to show how a machine should produce. © 2010 Growing Science Ltd.

In this paper, we introduce a novel type of recurrent artificial neural network, the shared layer perceptron, which allows forecasts that are robust by design. This is achieved by not over-fitting to a specific variable. An entire market is forecast. By training not one, but many networks, we obtain a distribution of outcomes. Further, multi-step forecasts are possible. Our system uses hidden states to model internal dynamics. This allows the network to build a memory and hardens it against external shocks. Using a single shared weight matrix offers the possibility of interpreting system output. An often cited disadvantage of neural networks, the black box character, is not an issue with our approach. We focus on two case studies: determining value at risk and transaction decision support.

This work is a look at markets to compare traditional expected utility theory of economic decision-making to the newer idea of Prospect Theory. Two learning algorithms, based on traditional expected utility and Prospect Theory, are designed and then compared under several scenarios designed to replicate various market conditions faced by investors. Deviations were analyzed to measure the effectiveness of the two algorithms and also the two models of economic decision making, where it was found that risk averseness described by Prospect Theory will lead to greater deviations in expected prices than more traditional models of economic decision making.

We model the defaultable stock price process as a time-changed Markov diffusion process with state-dependent local volatility and killing rate (default intensity). When the time change is a Lévy subordinator, the stock price process exhibits jumps with state-dependent Lévy measure. When the time change is a time integral of an activity rate process, the stock price process has local-stochastic volatility and default intensity. When the time change process is a Lévy subordinator in turn time changed with a time integral of an activity rate process, the stock price process has state-dependent jumps, local-stochastic volatility, and default intensity. We develop two analytical approaches to the pricing of credit and equity derivatives in this class of models. The two approaches are based on the Laplace transform inversion and the spectral expansion approach, respectively. If the resolvent (the Laplace transform of the transition semigroup) of the Markov process and the Laplace transform of the time change are both available in closed form, the expectation operator of the time-changed process is expressed in closed form as a single integral in the complex plane. If the payoff is square integrable, the complex integral is further reduced to a spectral expansion. To illustrate our general framework, we time change the jump-to-default extended constant elasticity of variance model of Carr and Linetsky (2006) and obtain a rich class of analytically tractable models with jumps, local-stochastic volatility, and default intensity.

A financial market also has been categorized on three domains: credit evaluation, portfolio management and financial prediction and planning. For each technique, most famous and especially recent researches have been discussed in comparative aspect. Results show that accuracy of these artificial intelligent methods is superior to that of traditional statistical methods in dealing with financial problems, especially regarding nonlinear patterns.

The asset pricing results are based on the three increasingly restrictive assumptions: absence of arbitrage, single-agent optimality, and equilibrium. These results are unified with two key concepts, state prices and martingales. Technicalities are given relatively little emphasis, so as to draw connections between these concepts and to make plain the similarities between discrete and continuous-time models. Readers will be particularly intrigued by this latest edition's most significant new feature: a chapter on corporate securities that offers alternative approaches to the valuation of corporate debt. Also, while much of the continuous-time portion of the theory is based on Brownian motion, this third edition introduces jumps--for example, those associated with Poisson arrivals--in order to accommodate surprise events such as bond defaults. Applications include term-structure models, derivative valuation, and hedging methods. Numerical methods covered include Monte Carlo simulation and finite-difference solutions for partial differential equations. Each chapter provides extensive problem exercises and notes to the literature. A system of appendixes reviews the necessary mathematical concepts. And references have been updated throughout.

We first extend the Bellman equation for the conditional expected return to cover a conditional probability density of the returns. Then we derive an extension of the TD-learning algorithm for estimating the return densities in an unknown environment. As test instances, several parametric density estimation algorithms are presented for the Gaussian, Laplace, and skewed Laplace distributions.

To reduce exposure to credit default, it thus becomes a crucial motive to select vital features to analyse the customer's credit profiles. This desired set of features can be generated through data mining techniques such as feature selection methods. However, each feature selection method has its advantages and limitations. In practice, using a single method inevitably introduces undesirable estimation bias. Instead, this paper proposes a bagging feature selection model, which is an ensemble learning approach, to identify the most significant features that determine the credit worthiness of customers. The experimental results demonstrate promising results using bagging feature selection model as compared to fundamental models for personal credit risk analysis. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Credit risk | Ensemble learning | Feature selection,11,0,,,,undefined,

In this article, we introduce a new hidden Markov model (HMM) with multiple observable sequences (MHMM), assuming that all the observable sequences are driven by a common hidden sequence, and utilize it to analyze default data in a network of sectors. Efficient estimation method is then adopted to estimate the model parameters. To further illustrate the advantages of MHMM, we compare the hidden risk state process obtained by MHMM with that from the traditional HMMs using credit default data. We then consider two applications of our MHMM. The calculation of two important risk measures: Value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) and the prediction of global risk state. We first compare the performance of MHMM and HMM in the calculation of VaR and ES in a portfolio of default-prone bonds. A logistic regression model is then considered for the prediction of global economic risk using our MHMM with default data.

We present two models for forecasting the portfolio loss and its probability distribution. In the first model, the loss for each nonperforming loan entails a change in provision over the risk horizon. The risk determinants are the single-name concentration, measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index, as well as a systematic factor and the idiosyncratic risk. Our second model allows for interportfolio diversification with a portfolio of performing loans because banks typically own both performing and nonperforming loans. In this model, the nonperforming loan is identified with its systematic risk. Both models allow for closed-form expressions of economic capital and for the capital charge of the single loan. We calibrate the macroeconomic model parameters statistically with a loss panel; the microeconomic parameters depend on the portfolio. The portfolio risk for nonperforming loans mainly depends on the volatility of the systematic economic factor. The dependence becomes more pronounced when interportfolio diversification is taken into account. The magnitude of interportfolio diversification is also marked. Finally, we calculate regulatory capital charges according to Basel II for past-due loans. The regulatory charges are on average smaller than our economic charges and, additionally, take the volatility of economic activity into account only implicitly. © Swiss Society for Financial Market Research 2009.",Economic capital | Loss given default | Nonperforming loan | Recovery | Regulatory capital,3,0,,,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

One of the key outputs of an internal rating system is the probability of default (PD), which reflects the likelihood that a counterparty will default on his/her financial obligation. Since the PD modelling problem basically boils down to a discrimination problem (defaulter or not), one may rely on the myriad of classification techniques that have been suggested in the literature. However, since the credit risk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation, they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines are less suitable due to their black box nature. Building upon previous research, we will use AntMiner to build internal rating systems for credit risk. AntMiner allows to infer a propositional rule set from a given data set, hereby using the principles from Ant Colony Optimization. Experiments will be conducted using various types of credit data sets (retail, small- and medium-sized enterprises and banks). It will be shown that the extracted rule sets are both powerful in terms of discriminatory power and comprehensibility.

Dynamic credit scoring tools is highly demanded by commercial banks with products like credit cards. However, till now practitioners almost only employ statistical scoring models such as regressions. Thus the purpose of this paper is to provide for a new direction of attempts in modeling consumer credit risk and behavioral scoring dynamics. The model features heterogeneity across consumers and over time, which is realized by such a process that the credit migration rate matrix of the fuzzy Markov chain is inferred by the fuzzy inference system based on a reasonable setting of rules for each consumer, and updated at each time. A training procedure based on maximum likelihood criterion is developed for model parameters' estimation. In addition to dynamic behavioral scoring and credit behavior forecast, the model can also evaluate credit quality of each consumer according to two indicators: credit level and credit volatility. © 2009 IEEE.",Behavioral scoring | Credit risk modeling | Fuzzy inference | Markov chain,4,0,,,,undefined,

Mathematically, such a problem can be reduced to estimating the probability of a stochastic process first to reach a boundary level. In most important applications in the financial industry, the FPT problem does not have an analytical solution and the development of efficient numerical methods becomes the only practical avenue for its solution. Most of our examples in this contribution are centered around the evaluation of default correlations in credit risk analysis, where we are concerned with the joint defaults of several correlated firms, the task that is reducible to a FPT problem. This task represents a great challenge for jump-diffusion processes (JDP). In this contribution, we develop further our previous fast Monte Carlo method in the case of multivariate (and correlated) JDP. This generalization allows us, among other things, to evaluate the default events of several correlated assets based on a set of empirical data. The developed technique is an efficient tool for a number of financial, economic, and business applications, such as credit analysis, barrier option pricing, macroeconomic dynamics, and the evaluation of risk, as well as for a number of other areas of applications in science and engineering, where the FPT problem arises.

After learning, the proposed method analyzes the entire history of activities and behaviors of all rule nodes, which reflects their levels of involvement or contribution during the process. The less qualified rule-relevant nodes can then be identified and removed, reducing the size and complexity of the HNFS. Upon the repetitive learning process, the method may be repetitively applied until a satisfactory result is obtained, simultaneously improving the performance and reducing the size and complexity. Incorporated with the method is a new HNFS architecture which addresses both the scalability problem experienced in rule based systems and the restriction of the ""overcrowded defuzzification"" problem found in hierarchical designs. In order to verify the performance, the proposed method has been successfully tested against five well-known classification problems whose results are provided and then discussed in the concluding remarks. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.",Hierarchical classification | Neuro-fuzzy systems | Structure adaptation,1,0,,,,undefined,

Now though, credit scoring is beginning to be used in relation to other decisions rather than the traditional one of assessing the default risk of a potential borrower. Lenders are changing their objectives from minimizing defaults to maximizing profits; using the internet and the telephone as application channels means lenders can price or customize their loans for individual consumers. The introduction of the Basel Capital Accord banking regulations and the credit crunch following the problems with securitizing sub prime mortgage mean one needs to be able to extend the default risk models from individual consumer loans to portfolios of such loans. Addressing these challenges requires new models that use credit scores as inputs. These in turn require extensions of what is meant by a credit score. This book reviews the current methodology for building scorecards, clarifies what a credit score really is, and the way that scoring systems are measured. It then looks at the models that can be used to address a number of these new challenges: how to obtain profitability based scoring systems; pricing new loans in a way that reflects their risk and also customise them to attract consumers; how the Basel Accord impacts on way credit scoring; and how credit scoring can be extended to assess the credit risk of portfolios of loans.",Basel accord | Consumer lending | Credit scoring | Portfolio level credit risk | Pricing | Profitability | Scoring systems,129,0,,,,undefined,

We present a new approach to default correlation modeling, where defaults of different names are driven by a common continuous-time Markov process. Individual default probabilities and default correlations can be calculated in closed form. We provide semi-analytic formulas for the pricing of CDO tranches via Laplace-transform techniques which are both fast and easy to implement. The model calibrates to quoted tranche prices with a high degree of precision and allows one to price non-standard tranches in a consistent and arbitrage-free manner. The number of parameters of the model is flexible and can be adjusted to adapt to the set of market data one is calibrating to.

The classical method to solve the interval transition probabilities of NHSMPs consists of directly applying any general quadrature method to some non-convolution integral equations. However, this approach has a considerable computational effort. Namely, N2-coupled integral equations with two variables must be solved, where N is the number of states. Therefore, this article proposes a more efficient mathematical formulation and numerical treatment, which are based on transition frequency densities and general quadrature methods respectively, for NHSMPs. The approach consists of only solving N-coupled integral equations with one variable and N straightforward integrations. Two examples in the context of reliability are also presented. The first one addresses a case where a semi-analytical solution is available. Then an example of application concerning pressure-temperature optical monitoring systems for oil wells is discussed.

In particular, we prove a strong comparison principle for the equation using an approach that overcomes some problems related to the appearance of integrals with respect to unbounded measures. In short, we extend the results in [20] to a general class of exponential additive models. The formulation constitutes a starting point for designing and analyzing ""easy to implement"" numerical algorithms for computing the value of an American option. © 2009 European Mathematical Society.",,2,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Although this recovery rate process is similar to that used in a structural model, the reduced form approach is maintained by utilizing information reduction in the sense of Guo, Jarrow, and Zeng.

The prices of e.g., bonds, options, and other assets in AJD models are given by extended pricing transforms that have an exponential-affine form; these transforms have been characterized in great generality by Duffie et al. [2000. Transform analysis and asset pricing for affine jump-diffusions. Econometrica 68, 1343-1376]. Calculating model prices requires inversion of these transforms, and this has limited the application of AJD models to the comparatively small subclass for which the transforms are available in closed form. This article seeks to widen the scope of AJD models amenable to practical application through approximate transform inversion techniques. More specifically, we develop the use of saddlepoint approximations for AJD models. These approximations facilitate the calculation of prices in AJD models whose transforms are not available explicitly.

This paradigm shift has attracted the attention of many researchers, and there has been a tremendous increase in the awareness and activities of derivative securities. In particular there is a need to devise new techniques to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions and approximations to capture the complex dynamics of pricing processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using an ad-hoc recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of war commodities such as gold and crude oil as well as currencies, which are increasingly gaining importance in the financial markets. The price predictions from the network, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks.

The first issue deals with how to obtain parsimony in the modeling of the effect of covariates. The standard way of incorporating covariates in multi-state models is by considering the transitions as separate building blocks, and modeling the effect of covariates for each transition separately, usually through a proportional hazards model for the transition hazard. This typically leads to a large number of regression coefficients to be estimated, and there is a real danger of over-fitting, especially when transitions with few events are present. We extend the reduced-rank ideas, proposed earlier in the context of competing risks, to multi-state models, in order to deal with this issue. The second issue addressed in this paper was motivated by the wish to obtain standard errors of the regression coefficients of the reduced-rank model. We propose a model-based resampling technique, based on repeatedly sampling trajectories through the multi-state model. The same ideas are also used for the estimation of prediction probabilities in general multi-state models and associated standard errors.

Based on empirical evidence, we propose a parsimonious model that is a mixture of (two) Markov chains, where the mixing is on the speed of movement among credit ratings. We estimate this model using credit rating histories and show that the mixture model statistically dominates the simple Markov model and that the differences between two models can be economically meaningful. The non-Markov property of our model implies that the future distribution of a firm's ratings depends not only on its current rating but also on its past rating history. Indeed we find that two firms with identical current credit ratings can have substantially different transition probability vectors. We also find that conditioning on the state of the business cycle or industry group does not remove the heterogeneity with respect to the rate of movement.

The models considered, in contrast to McNeil A and Wendin J [7], (J.

Macro-economic variables can also be included. Estimation of all model parameters are facilitated with a Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Special emphasis is given to the investigation of predictive capabilities of the models considered. In particular, predictable model specifications are used. The empirical study using default data from Standard and Poor's gives evidence that the correlation between credit ratings further apart decreases and is higher than the one induced by the autoregressive time dynamics.

Classically, the distribution p(y|x) is simple enough to ensure the Markovianity of p(x|y), that enables one to use different Bayesian restoration techniques. HMC model has recently been extended to ""pairwise Markov chain"" (PMC) model, in which one directly assumes the Markovianity of the pair Z=(X,Y), and which still enables one to recover X from Y. Finally, PMC has been extended to ""triplet Markov chain"" (TMC) model, which is obtained by adding a third chain U and considering the Markovianity of the triplet T=(X,U,Y). When U is not too complex, X can still be recovered from Y. Then U can model different situations, like non-stationarity or semi-Markovianity of (X,Y). Otherwise, PMC and TMC have been extended to pairwise ""partially"" Markov chains (PPMC) and triplet ""partially"" Markov chains (TPMC), respectively. In a PPMC Z=(X,Y) the distribution p(x|y) is a Markov distribution, but p(y|x) may not be and, similarly, in a TPMC T=(X, U, Y) the distribution p(x,u|y) is a Markov distribution, but p(y|x,u) may not be. However, both PPMC and TPMC can enable one to recover X from Y, and TPMC include different long-memory noises. The aim of this paper is to show how a particular Gaussian TPMC can be used to segment a discrete signal hidden with long-memory noise. An original parameter estimation method, based on ""Iterative Conditional Estimation"" (ICE) principle, is proposed and some experiments concerned with unsupervised segmentation are provided. The particular unsupervised segmentation method used in experiments can also be seen as identification of different stationarities in fractional Brownian noise, which is widely used in different problems in telecommunications, economics, finance, or hydrology. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

But, to what extent is this discount factor appropriate for cash flows emerging in capital budgeting?To answer this question, we introduce a framework for real asset valuation that considers both personal and corporate taxation. We first discuss broad circumstances under which personal taxes do not affect valuation. We show that the appropriate discount rate for equity-financed flows in a risk-neutral setting is an equity rate that differs from the riskless debt rate by a tax wedge due to the presence of personal taxation. We extend this result to the valuation of the interest tax shield for exogenous debt policy with default risk. Interest tax shields, which accrue at a net rate corresponding to the difference between the corporate tax rate and a tax rate related to the personal tax rates, can have either positive or negative values. We also provide an illustrative real options application of our valuation approach to the case of an option to delay investment in a project, showing that the application of Black and Scholes formula may be incorrect in presence of personal taxes. © Journal compilation © Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA 2008.",,8,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Such huge number of states discourages researchers or practitioners from using them directly.

To gain analytical and computational tractability both in order to estimate the model from empirical data and to compute the prices of derivative assets, financial models in applications are often Markovian. In the Markovian framework, the key object is the pricing operator mapping (possibly defaultable) future payments (payoffs) into present values. The pricing operators indexed by time form a pricing semigroup{Pt, t ≥ 0} in an appropriate payoff space, which can be interpreted as the transition semigroup of the underlying Markov process with the killing rate equal to the default-free interest rate plus default intensity. This framework encompasses a wide range of Markovian financial models. In applications it is important to have a tool kit of analytically tractable Markov processes with known transition semigroups that lead to closed-form expressions for value functions of derivative assets. In particular, an analytical simplification is possible when the process is a symmetric Markov process in the sense that there is a measure m on the state space D and the semigroup {Pt, t ≥ 0} is symmetric in the Hilbert space L2 (D, m). In this case we apply the Spectral Representation Theorem to obtain spectral representations for the semigroup and value functions of derivative assets. In this Chapter we survey the spectral method in general, as well as those classes of symmetric Markov processes for which the spectral representation can be obtained in closed form, thus generating closed form solutions to Markovian derivative pricing problems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) are explained heuristically as continuous-information versions of backward recursions on an information tree, and are used to formulate utility functions as well as optimality conditions. The role of scale invariance and quadratic BSDEs in obtaining tractable solutions is explained.

On the other hand, a new ant-based classification technique is proposed, named AntMiner+. The key differences between the proposed AntMiner+ and previous AntMiner versions are the usage of the better performing MAX-MIN ant system, a clearly defined and augmented environment for the ants to walk through, with the inclusion of the class variable to handle multiclass problems, and the ability to include interval rules in the rule list. Furthermore, the commonly encountered problem in ACO of setting system parameters is dealt with in an automated, dynamic manner. Our benchmarking experiments show an AntMiner+ accuracy that is superior to that obtained by the other AntMiner versions, and competitive or better than the results achieved by the compared classification techniques. © 2007 IEEE.",Ant colony optimization (ACO) | Classification | Comprehensibility | MAX-MIN ant system | Rule list,354,0,,,FWO,G.0615.05,Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek

In such models, the hidden process of interest X is a Markov chain, which must be estimated from an observable Y, interpretable as being a noisy version of X. The success of HMC is mainly due to the fact that the conditional probability distribution of the hidden process with respect to the observed process remains Markov, which makes possible different processing strategies such as Bayesian restoration. HMC have been recently generalized to ""Pairwise"" Markov chains (PMC) and ""Triplet"" Markov chains (TMC), which offer similar processing advantages and superior modeling capabilities. In PMC, one directly assumes the Markovianity of the pair (X, Y) and in TMC, the distribution of the pair (X, Y) is the marginal distribution of a Markov process (X, U, Y), where U is an auxiliary process, possibly contrived. Otherwise, the Dempster-Shafer fusion can offer interesting extensions of the calculation of the ""a posteriori"" distribution of the hidden data. The aim of this paper is to present different possibilities of using the Dempster-Shafer fusion in the context of different multisensor Markov models.

To cope with the growing complexity, narrowing margins, and shortening life-cycle of the individual derivative product, an efficient, yet modular, implementation of the pricing algorithms is necessary. Mathematical Finance is the first book to harmonize the theory, modeling, and implementation of today's most prevalent pricing models under one convenient cover. Building a bridge from academia to practice, this self-contained text applies theoretical concepts to real-world examples and introduces state-of-the-art, object-oriented programming techniques that equip the reader with the conceptual and illustrative tools needed to understand and develop successful derivative pricing models. Utilizing almost twenty years of academic and industry experience, the author discusses the mathematical concepts that are the foundation of commonly used derivative pricing models, and insightful Motivation and Interpretation sections for each concept are presented to further illustrate the relationship between theory and practice. In-depth coverage of the common characteristics found amongst successful pricing models are provided in addition to key techniques and tips for the construction of these models. The opportunity to interactively explore the book's principal ideas and methodologies is made possible via a related Web site that features interactive Java experiments and exercises. While a high standard of mathematical precision is retained, Mathematical Finance emphasizes practical motivations, interpretations, and results and is an excellent textbook for students in mathematical finance, computational finance, and derivative pricing courses at the upper undergraduate or beginning graduate level.

Specifically, we consider rare events associated with: (1) multi-dimensional light-tailed random walks, (2) with certain events involving heavy-tailed random variables and (3) queues and queueing networks. In addition, we review the recent literature on development of adaptive importance sampling techniques to quickly estimate common performance measures associated with finite-state Markov chains.

Finally, we study the term structure of credit spread, provide an algorithm for the estimation of the forward probabilities of transitions under the risk premium assumptions, and present an estimation method for the real-world probability sequences. © Applied Probability Trust 2006.",Credit rating | Inhomogeneous semi-Markov chain | Stochastic monotonicity,32,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

Fundamentally it consists in computing the default probability of a company going into debt. The problem can be studied by means of Markov transition models. The generalization of the transition models by means of homogeneous semi-Markov models is presented in this paper. The idea is to consider the credit risk problem as a reliability problem. In a semi-Markov environment it is possible to consider transition probabilities that change as a function of waiting time inside a state. The paper also shows how to apply semi-Markov reliability models in a credit risk environment. In the last section an example of the model is provided. © Springer-Verlag 2005.,,49,0,,,,undefined,

Asset pricing is considered in two essential situations, complete and incomplete markets, and the definition and use of a number of essential financial instruments is described. Specifically, stocks (as underlying processes), bonds and derivative products (and in particular call and put European and American options) are considered. The intent of the chapter is neither to cover all the many techniques and approaches that are used in asset pricing, nor to provide a complete introduction to financial asset pricing and financial engineering. Rather, the intent of the chapter is to outline through applications and problems the essential mathematical techniques and financial economic concepts used to assess the value of risky assets. An extensive set of references is also included to direct the motivated reader to further and extensive research in this broad and evolving domain of economic and financial engineering and mathematics that deals with asset pricing. The first part of the chapter (The Introduction and Sect. 47.1) deals with a definition of risk and outlines the basic terminology used in asset pricing. Further, some essential elements of the Arrow–Debreu framework that underlies the fundamental economic approach to asset pricing are introduced. A second part (Sect. 47.2), develops the concepts of risk-neutral pricing, no arbitrage and complete markets. A number of examples are used to demonstrate how we can determine a probability measure to which risk-neutral pricing can be applied to value assets when markets are complete. In this section, a distinction between complete and incomplete markets is also introduced. Sections 47.3, 47.4 and 47.5 provide an introduction to and examples of basic financial approaches and instruments. First, Sect. 47.3, outlines the basic elements of the consumption capital asset-pricing model (with the CAPM stated as a special case). Section 47.4 introduces the basic elements of net present value and bonds, calculating the yield curve as well as the term structure of interest rates and provides a brief discussion of default and rated bonds. Section 47.5 is a traditional approach to pricing of options using the risk-neutral approach (for complete markets). European and American options are considered and priced by using a number of examples. The Black–Scholes model is introduced and solved, and extensions to option pricing with stochastic volatility, underlying stock prices with jumps as well as options on bonds are introduced and solved for specific examples. The last section of the chapter focuses on incomplete markets and an outline of techniques that are used in pricing assets when markets are incomplete. In particular, the following problems are considered: the pricing of rated bonds (whether they are default-prone or not), engineered risk-neutral pricing (based on data regarding options or other derivatives) and finally we also introduce the maximum-entropy approach for calculating an approximate risk-neutral distribution.",Asset Price | Cash Flow | Implied Volatility | Option Price | Stochastic Volatility,1,0,,,,undefined,

This problem is formulated as the state changes according to a partially observable Markov chain, i.e., the current state cannot be observed but there exists some information regarding what a present state is. All information about the unobservable state are summarized by the probability distributions on the state space, and we employ the Bayes' theorem as a learning procedure. The total positivity of order two, or simply TP2, is a fundamental property to investigate sequential decision problems, and it also plays an important role in the Bayesian learning procedure for a partially observable Markov process. By using this property, we consider some relationships among prior and posterior information, and the optimal policy. We will also observe the probabilities to make a transition into each state after some additional transitions by empolying the optimal policy. In the stock market, suppose that the states correspond to the business situation of one company and if there is a state designating the default, then the problem is what time the stocks are sold off before bankrupt, and the probability to become bankrupt will be also observed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, one of the indices used to measure how susceptible a bank is to failure, is the capital adequacy ratio (CAR). We consider two types of such ratios, viz. non-risk-based (NRBCARs) and risk-based (RBCARs) CARs. According to the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), we can further categorize NRBCARs into leverage and equity capital ratios and RBCARs into Basel II and Tier 1 ratios. In general, these indices are calculated by dividing a measure of bank capital by an indicator of the level of bank risk. Our primary objective is to construct continuous-time stochastic models for the dynamics of each of the aforementioned ratios with the main achievement being the modelling of the Basel II capital adequacy ratio (Basel II CAR). This ratio is obtained by dividing the bank's eligible regulatory capital (ERC) by its risk-weighted assets (RWAs) from credit, market and operational risk. Mainly, our discussions conform to the qualitative and quantitative standards prescribed by the Basel II Capital Accord. Also, we find that our models are consistent with data from FDIC-insured institutions. Finally, we demonstrate how our main results may be applied in the banking sector.

One of the most pressing issues within computer security is predicting the impact of cyberattacks. Companies are often unable to execute the essential function of forecasting their security losses for the purpose of resource allocation and planning. They struggle to make rational decisions backed by quantitative data. This paper presents a model for the prediction of financial losses in organizations based on Markov Modeling; a consistent and objective quantitative technique. The focus and intent is to use this model to show the probability of the effect of cyberattacks. This Markov Model defines three states, each of which represents the level of monetary loss the company incurs due to attacks. Losses are normalized by the annual revenue of a company and corrected for systematic increases over time. The model will allow companies to determine the probability that their organization's risk of financial loss due to attacks will remain static or transition to a different level over a defined period of time.

There has been considerable dissatisfaction among ecologists, however, because succession has been found to display complex dynamics. The application of hidden Markov models (HMM) is proposed for two reasons: (1) they can have multiple states with observations that need not converge on a stable configuration and (2) the hidden states allow for the detection of underlying ecological processes. A comparative analysis is made between the well-known SMM and the lesser known HMM using a range of hypothetical species response types with concentration on the prediction of ecological observation sequences and the detection of underlying ecological processes. The HMM provides similar predictive ability to that of the SMM in the case of simple dynamics but shows considerably improved performance for complex dynamics. The HMM also provides increased interpretive capabilities by suggesting where transitions in underlying hidden states can be identified, even when not apparent in the observable dynamics. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

At first, this research appears consistent with firm practices. However, close scrutiny reveals disaffirming evidence. Many current so-called loyalty programs appear unrelated to the cultivation of customer brand loyalty and the creation of customer assets. True investments are up-front expenditures that produce much greater future returns. In contrast, many so-called loyalty programs are shams because they produce liabilities (e.g., promises of future rewards or deferred rebates) rather than assets. These programs produce short-term revenue from customers while producing substantial future obligations to those customers. Rather than showing trust by committing to the customer, the firm asks the customer, to trust the firm - that is, trust that future rewards are indeed forthcoming. The entire idea is antithetical to the concept of a customer asset. Many modern loyalty programs resemble old-fashioned trading stamps or deferred rebates that promise future benefits for current patronage.

It has reconfigurable processing units (neurons) and an evolvable system structure, which makes it an adaptive classification system for a variety of machine learning problems. Its multilayer structure can handle complex problems. Based on the entropy estimation, information theory-based learning is performed locally at each neuron. Neural parameters and connections that correspond to minimum entropy are adaptively set for each neuron. By choosing connections for each neuron, the system sets up its wiring and completes its self-organization. SOLAR classifies input data based on the weighted statistical information from all the neurons. The system classification ability has been simulated and experiments were conducted using test-bench data. Results show a very good performance compared to other classification methods. An important advantage of this structure is its scalability to a large system and ease of hardware implementation on regular arrays of cells. © 2005 IEEE.",Information theory-based machine learning | Multilayer learning array | Self-organizing neurons,33,0,,,OU,undefined,Ohio University

Although credit derivatives are important for hedging and securitizing credit risk - and thereby likely to enhance the sharing of such risk - some commentators have raised concerns that they may destabilize the banking sector. This paper investigates this issue in a simple model driven by costs of financial distress. The analysis identifies two effects of credit derivatives innovation - they enhance risk sharing as suggested by the hedging argument - but they also make further acquisition of risk more attractive. The latter effect, if dominant, can therefore destabilize the banking sector. The critical factor is, perhaps surprisingly, the competitive nature of the existing underlying credit markets. As these markets become more elastic the threat of destabilization increases. The paper discusses issues related to bank regulation within the context of the model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To accomplish this, the class of quadratic processes, consisting of those Markov state processes that yield QTSM, is introduced. The main result states that OU processes are the only conservative quadratic processes. In general, however, a quadratic potential can be added to allow QTSMs to model default risk. It is further shown that the exponent functions that are inherent in the definition of the quadratic property can be determined by a system of Riccati equations with a unique admissible parameter set.

PART B,,639-742,"This is a survey of the basic theoretical foundations of intertemporal asset pricing theory. The broader theory is first reviewed in a simple discrete-time setting, emphasizing the key role of state prices. The existence of state prices is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage. State prices, which can be obtained from optimizing investors' marginal rates of substitution, can be used to price contingent claims. In equilibrium, under locally quadratic utility, this leads to Breeden's consumption-based capital asset pricing model. American options call for special handling. After extending the basic modeling approach to continuous-time settings, we turn to such applications as the dynamics of the term structure of interest rates, futures and forwards, option pricing under jumps and stochastic volatility, and the market valuation of corporate securities. The pricing of defaultable corporate debt is treated from a direct analysis of the incentives or ability of the firm to pay, and also by standard reduced-form methods that take as given an intensity process for default. This survey does not consider asymmetric information, and assumes price-taking behavior and the absence of transactions costs and many other market imperfections. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Modeling the dynamics of interest rates, stock prices, foreign exchange rates, and macroeconomic factors, inter alia, is one of the most important topics in asset pricing studies. The second approach is nonparametric, which does not assume any restrictive functional form beyond regularity conditions. Under some regularity conditions, the diffusion process is a one-dimensional, regular, strong Morkov process with continuous sample paths and time-invariant stationary transition density. The drift and diffusion are the first two moments of the infinitesimal conditional distribution. The nonparametric estimation and testing of parametric diffusions are also elaborated. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,16,0,,,NSF,iJMS-0072 J00,National Science Foundation

Analysis patterns can greatly benefit this phase because they capture abstractions of situations that occur frequently in conceptual modeling. Naïve approaches to automate conceptual design with reuse of analysis patterns have had limited success because they do not emulate the learning that occurs over time. This research develops learning mechanisms for improving analysis pattern reuse in conceptual design. The learning mechanisms employ supervised learning techniques to support the generic reuse tasks of retrieval, adaptation, and integration, and emulate expert behaviors of analogy making and designing by assembly. They are added to a naïve approach and the augmented methodology implemented as an intelligent assistant to a designer for generating an initial conceptual design that a developer may refine. To assess the potential of the methodology to benefit practice, empirical testing is carried out on multiple domains and tasks of different sizes. The results suggest that the methodology has the potential to benefit practice.",Analysis Patterns | APSARA | Conceptual Design | Design Automation | Learning Mechanisms | Object-Oriented Systems | Reuse | Software Development,61,0,,,,undefined,

The aim of this paper is to explain how the Markov chain model leads to the known empirical findings such that prior rating changes carry predictive power for the direction of future rating changes and a firm with low (high, respectively) credit rating is more likely to be upgraded (downgraded) conditional on survival as the time horizon lengthens.
